# Implementation Steps for File Upload to S3

This document explains, step by step, how the backend file upload functionality was implemented to meet the requirements in `Story Requirements.md`.

## 1. Install Required Python Packages
- Added `boto3` (for AWS S3 integration) and `python-multipart` (for file upload handling) to `requirements.txt`.
- Ran `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

## 2. S3 Upload Logic in Controller
- Updated `frontend/app/controllers/main_controller.py`:
  - Imported `boto3`, `os`, and related modules for S3 and file handling.
  - Added a function `upload_file_to_s3` to upload files to a specified S3 bucket using credentials from environment variables.
  - Added a function `handle_file_upload` to:
    - Validate the uploaded file (PDF only, max 5 MB).
    - Secure the filename and generate an S3 key.
    - Upload the file to S3 and return the file URL in a JSON response.
    - Return appropriate error messages and status codes for invalid uploads.

## 3. Flask Route for Upload Endpoint
- Updated `frontend/app/routes.py`:
  - Registered a new POST route `/upload` that calls `main_controller.handle_file_upload`.

## 4. Environment Variables
- The following environment variables must be set in your `.env` file:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_REGION`
  - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`

## 5. Error Handling and Validation
- The backend checks:
  - File is present in the request.
  - File is a PDF and not empty.
  - File size does not exceed 5 MB.
  - S3 bucket is configured.
- Returns clear error messages and HTTP status codes for each failure case.

## 6. Integration with Frontend
- The `/upload` endpoint is ready to receive POST requests from the React frontend (or tools like Postman).
- On success, returns `{ "filename": ..., "url": ... }`.
- On failure, returns `{ "error": ... }` with an appropriate status code.

## 7. Next Steps
- The backend is now ready for file upload integration with the frontend.
- If you want to store file metadata in a database or add more features (like progress tracking or file removal), further backend changes can be made as needed.

This implementation fulfills the backend requirements for the file upload user story, ensuring secure, validated, and robust uploads to AWS S3.
