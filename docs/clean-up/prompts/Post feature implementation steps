Implementation Strategy:
For your current completed features:
session/ → Move to completed/session/ with:
IMPLEMENTATION.md covering React Context architecture, toast notifications, session reset
LESSONS-LEARNED.md covering what worked well in the 24 passing tests
original-docs/ with all current documentation
ci-local-run-fixes/ → Move to completed/ci-local-run-fixes/ with:
IMPLEMENTATION.md covering CI pipeline setup, test optimization (161/161 tests)
LESSONS-LEARNED.md covering performance improvements (120s → 9s)
original-docs/ with all current documentation
Ongoing process:
When a feature completes, create the 2 summary docs
Move to completed/
Update overall-progress/ to reflect new structure
Would you like me to help implement this structure? I can start by creating the active/ and completed/ folders and moving the appropriate features, then create the summary documents for your completed features.
