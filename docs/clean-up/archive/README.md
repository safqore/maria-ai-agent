# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation files that have been consolidated into the main README.md file in the project root.

These files are kept for historical reference only and should not be considered current documentation.

## Archived Files

- `config-strategy.md` - The project's configuration strategy, now in README.md under "Configuration Guide"
- `PORT_CONFIGURATION.md` - Port configuration documentation, now in README.md under "Configuration Guide"

## Consolidation Reason

These files were consolidated as part of our effort to follow the "single source of truth" principle for project documentation,
making it easier for new developers to find all necessary information in the main README.md file.
