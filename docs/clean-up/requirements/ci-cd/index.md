### Key Implementation Details

### CI Pipeline Architecture

- GitHub Actions workflow with parallel backend and frontend jobs
- Automated testing, linting, and building on every push/PR
- Python 3.9 backend with pytest, black, flake8
- Node.js 20.x frontend with jest, prettier, eslint

### Current Implementation

- âœ… Platform selection (GitHub Actions)
- âœ… Backend CI job (Python testing pipeline)
- âœ… Frontend CI job (React/TypeScript testing pipeline)
- âœ… Workflow triggers (main and feature branches)
- âœ… Documentation structure

### Planned Integration

- ðŸ“‹ Docker containerization for both applications
- ðŸ“‹ Continuous deployment to cloud environments
- ðŸ“‹ Security scanning and vulnerability management
- ðŸ“‹ Test coverage reporting and metrics

### Testing Coverage

- âœ… Backend: pytest with SQLite in-memory DB
- âœ… Frontend: jest with React Testing Library
- âœ… Static analysis: black, flake8, prettier, eslint
