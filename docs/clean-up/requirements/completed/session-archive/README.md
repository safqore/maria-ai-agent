**The session management feature is fully implemented and operational as of June 29, 2025.**

### âœ… **COMPLETED FEATURES**

- **Full Session Context Architecture**: Centralized state management with React Context
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all session operations using react-hot-toast

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messaging
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate dev/production configurations

### ðŸŽ¯ **KEY ACHIEVEMENTS**

- **Zero Props Drilling**: Eliminated need to pass sessionUUID through component props
- **User Experience**: Smooth notifications and confirmations for all session operations
- **Developer Experience**: Development controls that can be easily enabled/disabled
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive backend service testing with edge cases
- **Production Ready**: Environment-based feature flags and configuration

## Requirements & Decisions

### Session Lifecycle

- A session begins when the frontend generates a UUID (if one does not exist in localStorage)
- The UUID is stored in both localStorage and React state for persistence across reloads
- A session is only considered complete after the user provides and verifies their email address
- Incomplete sessions and their data (including uploaded files) are deleted if abandoned
- If the UUID is missing or tampered with, the frontend generates a new UUID and shows a reset message

### Security & Privacy

- All data transmission uses SSL/TLS
- GDPR compliance with explicit user consent for storing personal data
- Users can withdraw consent or delete their account via the chatbot interface after verification
- Data minimization, access, portability, rectification, and retention policies are enforced

### Orphaned File Cleanup Implementation

- Files in S3 under `uploads/{uuid}/` where the UUID is not in the database and the folder is older than 30 minutes
- Cleanup process runs every 30 minutes as a scheduled automation
- Before deletion, the process double-checks the UUID against the database for safety
- All deletions and errors are logged for audit and recovery

## Overview

The session management system implements several key features:

- Unique session identifier (UUID) generation and validation (âœ… Implemented)
- Session persistence with browser localStorage (âœ… Implemented)
- User session persistence in a database (âœ… Implemented)
- Association of uploaded files with user sessions via UUID namespacing (âœ… Implemented)
- Comprehensive audit logging for session events (âœ… Implemented)
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned files (âœ… Implemented)
- Session Context for React components (âœ… Implemented)

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a service-oriented architecture with clean separation of concerns:

1. **Backend Services**:

   - Session service for UUID management (âœ… Complete)
   - Audit logging service for tracking events (âœ… Complete)
   - File upload service with session association (âœ… Complete)

2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Session management hooks and context (âœ… Complete)
   - Persistent session storage in the browser (âœ… Complete)
   - File upload integration with session IDs (âœ… Complete)

## Implementation Decisions

### UUID Management

- Frontend is responsible for UUID generation, with backend validation (âœ… Implemented)
- Backend ensures UUIDs are never duplicated and always unique for every session (âœ… Implemented)
- Validation and generation endpoints use separate routes following single responsibility principle (âœ… Implemented)
- All validation and generation attempts are logged as audit events (âœ… Implemented)
- On UUID collision, the backend retries up to 3 times to generate a unique UUID (âœ… Implemented)

### Security Implementation

- CORS restricts backend endpoints to only accept requests from the frontend domain (âœ… Implemented)
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute) prevents abuse and DDoS attacks (âœ… Implemented)
- All input is strictly validated, and endpoints have reasonable timeouts (âœ… Implemented)
- Audit logs and error logs are monitored for suspicious activity (âœ… Implemented)

### Error Handling

- Session reset message: "Your session has been reset due to a technical issue. Please start again." (âœ… Implemented)
- General error message: "The system has encountered an error, which has been notified to the administrator to investigate. Please try again later." (âœ… Implemented)
- Admin email notifications include relevant logs with user UUID, error logs, timestamp, and user actions (âœ… Implemented)
