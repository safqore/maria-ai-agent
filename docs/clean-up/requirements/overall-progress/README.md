   - **Fix Required**: Database initialization in performance tests

2. **`test_concurrent_requests`** (Session API Integration)
   - **Issue**: Database table not found in concurrent requests
   - **Impact**: CRITICAL - Core API functionality affected
   - **Root Cause**: Test isolation issues with database setup
   - **Fix Required**: Proper test database initialization

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (Feature Blocking)

3. **`test_concurrent_api_requests`** (API Performance)
   - **Issue**: Client nesting errors and low throughput
   - **Impact**: HIGH - API performance and reliability
   - **Root Cause**: Test client management issues
   - **Fix Required**: Isolated test client creation

## 📁 Progress Tracking Structure Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION**: Create dedicated `overall-progress/` folder (current approach) rather than using template folder.

### Why Not Template Folder:

- Template folder serves as a blueprint for new requirements
- Mixing project-wide tracking with template structure creates confusion
- Template should remain clean for future requirement creation

### Recommended Structure:

```
requirements/
├── overall-progress/          # ✅ This folder - Project-wide tracking
│   ├── README.md             # Main status overview (this file)
│   ├── index.md              # Navigation and quick links
│   ├── test-status.md        # Detailed test analysis and fixes
│   ├── deployment-readiness.md # Production deployment checklist
│   ├── milestone-tracking.md # Major milestone progress
│   └── priorities.md         # Current sprint priorities and blockers
├── template/                 # ✅ Keep separate - Clean blueprint
└── [other requirement folders]
```
