# Copilot Implementation Questions: UUID Validation/Generation Endpoint

Date: 2025-06-23

## Context
These questions were raised during the planning and implementation of the backend UUID validation/generation endpoint, as required by the user session and file association strategy.

### General Questions (All Requirements)
1. Are there any existing libraries, utilities, or patterns in the codebase that should be reused for session, file, or audit management?
2. What is the preferred error handling and user messaging strategy for both backend and frontend (beyond what is already documented)?
3. Should all audit logs be written synchronously or asynchronously (e.g., background task/queue)?
4. What is the expected frequency and trigger for orphaned file cleanup (scheduled job, on-demand, on session deletion, etc.)?
5. Is there a preferred format or tool for database schema migrations and documentation?
6. Should privacy notice and consent in the frontend be implemented as a modal, checkbox, or both?
7. Are there any additional security or compliance requirements not covered in the current documentation?
8. What is the expected retention period for audit logs and deleted user data?
9. Should the system support multi-language or accessibility features for privacy notices and consent?
10. Are there any integration points with external monitoring, alerting, or analytics systems for error and audit events?

### UUID Endpoint-Specific Questions
1. Should the endpoint support both validation and generation in a single route (e.g., POST with/without UUID), or should these be separate endpoints?
2. What is the preferred response structure? (e.g., always return `{uuid: ..., status: ...}`, or only on changes/errors?)
3. Should the endpoint also log audit events for validation/generation attempts?
4. Is there a maximum number of allowed UUID collisions before returning an error?
5. Should the endpoint be authenticated in any way, or is it open as per the current requirements?

These questions are intended to clarify requirements and ensure alignment with the overall session management and security strategy.
