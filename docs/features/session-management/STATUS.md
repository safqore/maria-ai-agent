# Session Management Status

## Current State
- ✅ Session UUID generation and validation (24/24 backend tests, 18/18 frontend tests)
- ✅ Session persistence with localStorage and React state
- ✅ Session reset functionality with user notification
- ✅ Orphaned file cleanup (30-minute timeout)
- ✅ Rate limiting (10 requests/minute per IP)

## Implementation Details
- Frontend generates UUIDs with backend validation and collision handling
- Session UUIDs stored in both localStorage and React state for persistence
- Session reset clears all user data including uploaded files
- Session reset triggers full app reload with user notification via modal and toast
- Backend and frontend session timeouts are synchronized
- All session data transmission uses SSL/TLS
- GDPR and privacy requirements enforced for all session data
- Orphaned file cleanup is safe and double-checks UUIDs before deletion
- All session events are logged for audit and debugging
- Session reset UI is always available via modal and toast
- SessionContext and hooks eliminate the need for props drilling
- Rate limiting (10 requests/minute) is sufficient for session endpoints
- All error handling is consistent between frontend and backend
