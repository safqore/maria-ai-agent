# Email Verification Status

## Current State
- ✅ Email service provider: Gmail SMTP with App Password (smtp.gmail.com:587)
- ✅ Email templates: HTML templates with branding
- ✅ Sender email: noreply@safqore.com (Maria sender name)
- ✅ User flow: Automatic progression to next chat state after verification
- ✅ Session reset integration: Use existing SessionContext.resetSession() pattern
- ✅ Rate limits: 30-second cooldown and 3 resend attempts
- ✅ Verification records: 24-hour auto-cleanup via repository cleanup method
- ✅ Verification codes: 6-digit numeric for better UX
- ✅ Error messages: User-friendly with "please" and "thanks" for polite messaging
- ✅ Repository pattern: EmailVerificationRepository extends BaseRepository pattern
- ✅ Database transactions: Use existing TransactionContext for all operations
- ✅ FSM integration: Use nextTransition property in API responses
- ✅ Testing database: SQLite for all test environments
- ✅ Session resets: Use SessionContext.resetSession() and SessionResetModal

## Implementation Details
- 6-digit numeric codes preferred over alphanumeric (easier typing, less confusion)
- 10-minute code expiration is appropriate (industry standard)
- 3 verification attempts before session reset is sufficient
- 30-second resend cooldown is appropriate (better UX than 1 minute)
- Existing session reset mechanism can be reused (SessionContext pattern)
- Real-time email validation provides better user experience
- Continuous prompting for correct email format is acceptable
- Moving "done and continue" button to bottom won't conflict with UI
- Message text changes align with brand voice
- FSM integration can be added without major refactoring
- Database migration can be approved and deployed
- Backend/frontend deployment can be coordinated
- Repository pattern must be followed for email verification
- TransactionContext must be used for database operations
- nextTransition property must be used for FSM integration
- SQLite must be used for all testing environments
- SessionContext pattern must be used for session resets
