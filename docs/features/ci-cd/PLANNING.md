# CI/CD Deployment Planning

**Last Updated:** January 8, 2025

## 10-Line Deployment Strategy

1. **Recommended Architecture**: Vercel (frontend) + Fly.io (backend) + Supabase (database) + AWS S3 (file storage) for optimal cost-performance balance, leveraging each platform's strengths while maintaining existing S3 file upload integration
2. **Cost Analysis**: Total deployment cost $1-5/month with Vercel free tier (100GB bandwidth), Fly.io free tier (3 shared VMs), Supabase free tier (500MB database), and minimal AWS S3 costs for file storage, significantly lower than Railway's $5-10/month backend costs
3. **Frontend Deployment**: Vercel chosen over Railway for React app due to purpose-built React optimization, automatic builds, global CDN, zero configuration, and $0 cost for static file hosting, while Railway is overkill for static assets
4. **Backend Deployment**: Fly.io selected for Python backend due to excellent Python support, optimized Dockerfile already configured, global edge deployment, and $0 cost within free tier limits, avoiding Railway's compute-time billing model
5. **Database Strategy**: Keep existing Supabase investment due to implemented Row Level Security (RLS), auth integration, analytics views, GDPR compliance, and 500MB free tier, migration cost outweighs $0 savings
6. **File Storage**: Maintain AWS S3 integration for file uploads despite adding 4th platform complexity, as $1-5/month cost is minimal compared to development effort to replace working system
7. **Migration Complexity**: Avoid migrating away from Supabase due to weeks of development work invested in RLS policies, auth integration, analytics views, and database functions that would be lost
8. **Deployment Workflow**: GitHub Actions CD pipeline with parallel backend/frontend deployments, environment variables managed through platform secrets, automatic deployments on main branch pushes
9. **Growth Strategy**: Start with $1-5/month architecture, scale to $25/month Supabase Pro when database exceeds 500MB, maintain Vercel and Fly.io free tiers for frontend/backend hosting
10. **Technical Debt**: Preserve existing sophisticated Supabase setup rather than downgrading for short-term cost savings, as enterprise features provide competitive advantage and future-proofing
