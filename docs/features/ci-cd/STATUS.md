# CI/CD Status

## Current State
- ✅ Migrations run automatically before tests
- ✅ Alembic is the standard migration tool for SQLAlchemy applications
- ✅ SQLite is the default for all test runs (local/dev/test environments)
- ✅ Automated database setup with migrations applied before test execution
- ✅ Thread-local database connections for concurrent testing
- ✅ SQLite is sufficient for all development and testing scenarios
- ✅ Alembic migrations provide better version control than raw SQL scripts
- ✅ Automatic migration application before tests ensures test reliability
- ✅ Database initialization scripts work from both project root and backend
- ✅ Test database is separate from development database (maria_ai_test.db)

## Implementation Details
- Migrations should run automatically before tests to ensure consistent test environment
- Alembic is the standard migration tool for SQLAlchemy applications
- SQLite should be the default for all test runs (local/dev/test environments)
- Automated database setup with migrations applied before test execution
- Use thread-local database connections or skip concurrent tests that require thread safety
- SQLite is sufficient for all development and testing scenarios
- Alembic migrations provide better version control than raw SQL scripts
- Automatic migration application before tests ensures test reliability
- Database initialization scripts should work from both project root and backend
- Test database should be separate from development database
