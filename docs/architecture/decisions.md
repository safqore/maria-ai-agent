# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This file will contain all major architectural decisions made across the project to ensure consistency and prevent conflicts.

## Database Architecture

### Repository Pattern
- **Decision**: All database access must go through Repository pattern
- **Rationale**: Provides abstraction, testability, and consistency
- **Implementation**: Extend `BaseRepository<T>` for all models
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

### Transaction Management
- **Decision**: Use `TransactionContext` for all database operations
- **Rationale**: Ensures atomicity and proper error handling
- **Implementation**: Wrap all service operations in TransactionContext
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

## API Architecture

### Response Format
- **Decision**: Use `nextTransition` property for FSM integration
- **Rationale**: Provides clear state transition management
- **Implementation**: All API responses include nextTransition when applicable
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

### Error Handling
- **Decision**: Structured error responses with consistent format
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent error handling across features
- **Implementation**: Use existing `errors.py` patterns
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

## Frontend Architecture

### State Management
- **Decision**: Use React Context for feature state management
- **Rationale**: Provides component isolation and testability
- **Implementation**: Create Context providers for each major feature
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

### Session Management
- **Decision**: Use `SessionContext` for session resets
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent user experience
- **Implementation**: Call `resetSession()` instead of `window.reload`
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

## Configuration Architecture

### Service Separation
- **Decision**: Use separate configuration files for each service (frontend/backend)
- **Rationale**: Reflects deployment reality, prevents conflicts, follows stack standards
- **Implementation**: `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env` with service-specific variables
- **Established**: Current system standard

### Environment Variable Strategy
- **Decision**: Use standard environment variable names per technology stack
- **Rationale**: Follows established conventions, reduces configuration complexity
- **Implementation**: Backend uses `PORT=5000`, Frontend uses `PORT=3000` and `REACT_APP_*` prefix
- **Established**: Current system standard

### Configuration Loading
- **Decision**: No cross-service configuration sharing or propagation
- **Rationale**: Maintains clean separation of concerns and deployment independence
- **Implementation**: Each service loads only its own configuration file
- **Established**: Current system standard

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- **Decision**: [Current authentication pattern]
- **Rationale**: [Why this pattern was chosen]
- **Implementation**: [How it's implemented]
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]

### Data Protection
- **Decision**: [Current data protection approach]
- **Rationale**: [Why this approach was chosen]
- **Implementation**: [How it's implemented]
- **Established**: [Date when this was established]
