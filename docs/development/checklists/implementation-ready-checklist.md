# Implementation Ready Checklist

Use this checklist before starting any implementation to ensure you're ready and won't conflict with other work.

## Architecture Validation

### Pattern Compliance
- [ ] Confirmed database access pattern (Repository/Service/Direct)
- [ ] Confirmed API response pattern (nextTransition vs nextState)
- [ ] Confirmed error handling pattern (structured errors)
- [ ] Confirmed authentication pattern (session-based/API key)
- [ ] Confirmed logging pattern (audit utils)

### Integration Points
- [ ] Identified all shared services that will be used
- [ ] Confirmed API endpoints won't conflict
- [ ] Confirmed database tables won't conflict
- [ ] Identified all other features that might be affected
- [ ] Planned for any shared utility updates

## Technical Readiness

### Dependencies
- [ ] All required dependencies are available
- [ ] Database migrations are planned and tested
- [ ] External services are accessible
- [ ] Environment configuration is complete
- [ ] All blockers have been resolved

### Development Environment
- [ ] Local development environment is working
- [ ] Database is set up and accessible
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] Build process is working
- [ ] Debugging tools are configured

## Documentation Complete

### Feature Documentation
- [ ] `STATUS.md` is current and detailed
- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` has all technical decisions
- [ ] `IMPLEMENTATION.md` has detailed implementation plan
- [ ] `BLOCKERS.md` is empty or all blockers resolved

### Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Any new patterns are documented
- [ ] Integration map is updated
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly documented
- [ ] Breaking changes are identified and approved

## Team Coordination

### Communication
- [ ] Other team members are aware of the implementation
- [ ] Any shared resources are coordinated
- [ ] Deployment timeline is confirmed
- [ ] Code review process is planned

### Conflict Prevention
- [ ] No other features are modifying the same files
- [ ] Database schema changes are coordinated
- [ ] API changes are coordinated
- [ ] Shared component changes are coordinated

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests are planned
- [ ] Integration tests are planned
- [ ] End-to-end tests are planned
- [ ] Performance tests are planned (if needed)

### Code Quality
- [ ] Code review process is planned
