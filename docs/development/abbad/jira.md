# Codebase Optimization: Remove Redundant Code from Maria AI Agent

## Summary
Perform a comprehensive audit and cleanup of redundant code across the Maria AI Agent's frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Flask/Python) codebases to improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, and optimize performance.

## Description
Our codebase has accumulated redundant code over time through multiple development cycles. This includes unused functions, duplicate logic, obsolete files, and unnecessary imports. We need to systematically identify and safely remove these elements while ensuring no functional impact.

## Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis and Identification

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
1. Use static analysis tools:
   ```bash
   # Install and run ESLint with unused-imports plugin
   cd frontend
   npm install eslint-plugin-unused-imports --save-dev
   npx eslint --ext .ts,.tsx src/ --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern
   
   # Run TypeScript compiler in noEmit mode to find unused code
   npx tsc --noEmit
   
   # Use Dependency Cruiser to visualize and find orphaned modules
   npm install -g dependency-cruiser
   depcruise --include-only "^src" --output-type dot src | dot -T svg > dependency-graph.svg
   ```

2. Run bundle analyzer to identify large/unused dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run build -- --stats
   npx webpack-bundle-analyzer build/bundle-stats.json
   ```

#### Backend (Flask/Python)
1. Use static analysis tools:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   
   # Install tools
   pip install vulture pyflakes pylint
   
   # Find unused code
   vulture app/
   
   # Check for unused imports
   pyflakes app/
   
   # Run comprehensive linting
   pylint app/
   ```

2. Check for duplicate code:
   ```bash
   pip install pylint
   pylint --disable=all --enable=duplicate-code app/
   ```

### Phase 2: Documentation and Planning

Document findings in a spreadsheet with the following columns:
- File path
- Line numbers
- Type of redundancy (unused function, duplicate logic, etc.)
- Risk assessment (low/medium/high)
- Test coverage status
- Recommended action

### Phase 3: Implementation (by priority and risk)

1. Low-risk items (unused imports, commented-out code)
2. Medium-risk items (unused functions with test coverage)
3. High-risk items (potentially used code with complex dependencies)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All unused imports are removed from both frontend and backend
- [ ] Unused functions, variables, and components are safely removed
- [ ] Duplicate logic is consolidated where appropriate
- [ ] Obsolete files are identified and removed from the codebase
- [ ] No new errors or warnings are introduced in the console logs
- [ ] All tests pass after changes with no reduction in code coverage
- [ ] Bundle size is reduced by at least 5% for frontend
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect removed functionality (if applicable)
- [ ] PR includes before/after metrics showing improvement in code quality

## Testing and Validation Procedure

### Frontend
1. Run all Jest tests after each significant removal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

2. Perform manual testing of key user flows:
   - Chat functionality
   - File upload capabilities
   - State transitions in the finite state machine

3. Verify bundle size reduction:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Backend
1. Run pytest suite after each significant removal:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest -v --cov=app
   ```

2. Verify API endpoints still function correctly:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:[PORT]/api/health
   # Test other critical endpoints
   ```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- **High-risk areas**: State management logic, API integration points
- **Mitigation**: Implement changes incrementally with thorough testing between each step
- **Rollback plan**: Each PR should be small and focused for easy rollback if needed

## Definition of Done

- All identified redundant code is removed or documented with explicit reasons for retention
- No functionality regression in either frontend or backend
- All CI/CD pipelines pass successfully
- Code review completed by at least one other team member
- Documentation updated to reflect any changes that affect developers
