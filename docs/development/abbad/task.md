You are a senior frontend engineer. Configure the static analysis environment for a React/TypeScript project. Complete the following tasks:

1. **Install and set up ESLint** with the unused-imports plugin for the frontend codebase.
2. **Configure the TypeScript compiler** (`tsconfig.json`) to enable strict type checking and static analysis.
3. **Install and configure Dependency Cruiser** to visualize and analyze module dependencies.
4. **Set up Webpack Bundle Analyzer** for bundle inspection.

**Requirements:**
- Provide installation commands and configuration file snippets for each tool.
- Ensure all configurations follow best practices for React/TypeScript projects.
- Reference the correct project folder structure.
- Do not hardcode any port values; use environment variables if needed.
- Document any new environment variables in the main README.md.
- All documentation and setup instructions must be consolidated in the root README.md.
