My Setup & Workflow
Here’s how I use Claude across different projects:

1. Prompt Optimization with Lyra
I use a custom Lyra prompt (google it) to optimizer and refine every request I send to Claude. This was a huge unlock for me.

2. Jira Ticket Rewrites
For any new task, I start by rewriting the Jira ticket using Claude. This gives it a clean, focused context to work from.

3. Chunking the Work
Next, I ask Claude to break the ticket down into the smallest possible implementation chunks. Then I take the first chunk and run it through my prompt optimizer.

4. Scoped Prompting
Here’s where the magic happens: I’m very restrictive with what Claude can touch. Sometimes I define the interface. Sometimes I point it to a specific method. Other times I ask for red/green unit tests first. The goal is to keep the output scoped to digestible pieces I can read and assess in minutes.

5. Iterative Development
I iterate on each chunk until it’s solid. Then I move on to the next. Rinse and repeat.

This setup has been a game-changer for me. Claude doesn’t just help me code—it helps me think, organize, and stay sharp in environments where the complexity would otherwise slow me down.

So if any of you old hats saw that recent study of 16 engineers and how Claude slowed them down... maybe read this workflow before you jump into using AI as your friendly pair programmer. Understanding the tools, limit it's scope, being consistent in your process and finding out what works for you are they keys to this AI kingdom.
