# Q's Questions:

1 - Most people do not have files to upload available on their mobile device, yet mobile devices are the most common way to access the web. Should it not be possible for a user to start a session on their mobile device, realise that documents sit on their laptop, login to their laptop and upload the files, via the same session? i.e. how can we ensure a session is accessible across devices?

2 - if a user has uploaded a file and provided their email address but for some reason they come back to the page again the id is not reset and the new details will be stored again against it so is the new email address, how will we handle this?
