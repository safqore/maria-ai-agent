## Phase 3: Frontend Improvements - Lower Risk (Completed)

1. **Create API service layer** ✅
   - ✅ Created API directory with configuration
   - ✅ Implemented separate API modules for different features (session, chat, file)
   - ✅ Created centralized error handling for API calls
   - ✅ Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API responses
   - ✅ Added unified error handling with ApiError class
   - ✅ Created type-safe API implementations with proper error handling

2. **Refactor custom hooks** ✅
   - ✅ Improved error handling in useSessionUUID hook
   - ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces
   - ✅ Added resetSession functionality
   - ✅ Updated implementation to use new API service
   - ✅ Created useChatApi hook for chat-related API operations
   - ✅ Implemented useApiRequest hook for standardized API request handling
   - ✅ Fixed React 18 compatibility issues in hook tests
   - ✅ Added proper TypeScript types to hook parameters and returns

3. **Break down large components** ✅
   - ✅ Split FileUpload component into smaller components:
     - FileUploadButton for file selection
     - FileStatusItem for individual file status
     - FileStatusList for managing multiple files
   - ✅ Split ChatContainer into smaller components:
     - ChatMessages for rendering messages
     - ChatControls for handling user input
     - ChatActions for contextual actions like file upload
   - ✅ Created feature-based directory structure for components
   - ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - ✅ Created comprehensive tests for all new components
   - ✅ Updated imports in existing components
   - ✅ Fixed component prop type issues and TypeScript errors

4. **Implement consistent error handling** ✅
   - ✅ Created ErrorBoundary component for handling component errors
   - ✅ Implemented centralized error handling in API services
   - ✅ Added error states and handling in hooks
   - ✅ Updated components to use consistent error handling patterns
   - ✅ Added proper error boundary tests with error simulation
   - ✅ Created standardized error display components

5. **Improve state management** ✅
   - ✅ Created ChatContext for centralized chat state management
   - ✅ Created FileUploadContext for file upload state
   - ✅ Implemented context providers with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - ✅ Created adapter hooks to bridge old and new state management patterns
   - ✅ Added comprehensive tests for contexts and state management

   - ✅ Improved action typing with proper payload types

## Phase 3 Complete - Ready for Next Phase

✅ All Phase 3 objectives have been completed
✅ All tests pass
✅ Application builds successfully with no ESLint errors
❌ Regression: Chat buttons are not displaying in the chat window
  - This functionality was working before Phase 3 refactoring
  - Root cause may be related to changes in the state management or component structure
  - This issue should be addressed as a priority before proceeding further with Phase 4

✅ Frontend code is now more maintainable with better separation of concerns
✅ Error handling is consistent across the application
✅ Documentation has been updated to reflect the new architecture
✅ TypeScript typing has been improved throughout the codebase
✅ Component structure follows modern React best practices
✅ API layer provides a clean separation between UI and backend communication

## Next Phase: Backend Improvements - Higher Risk

### Summary of Progress So Far

We have successfully completed three phases of the refactoring plan:

**Phase 1: Setup and Preparation**
- Established code quality standards with linting and formatting
- Improved documentation across the codebase
- Set up testing infrastructure for both frontend and backend

**Phase 2: Backend Improvements (Lower Risk)**
- Implemented a service layer to separate business logic from routes
- Added centralized error handling with custom exception classes
- Created schema-based request validation with Marshmallow

**Phase 3: Frontend Improvements (Lower Risk)**
- Created a centralized API service layer with proper error handling
- Refactored custom hooks with improved TypeScript typing and error handling
- Split large components into smaller, more focused components
- Implemented consistent error handling with ErrorBoundary components
- Improved state management with React Context and useReducer

The codebase is now more maintainable, has better separation of concerns, and follows modern best practices for both React and Flask development. All tests are passing, and the application builds successfully without errors. However, a regression has been identified where chat buttons are no longer displaying in the chat window. This functionality worked correctly before the Phase 3 refactoring and needs to be fixed before proceeding with Phase 4.

### Next Steps: Regression Fixes and Backend Improvements (Higher Risk)

Before proceeding with backend improvements, we need to address the following regression:

1. **Fix Chat Button Display Issue**
   - Investigate why buttons are not displaying in the chat window after Phase 3 refactoring
   - Check ChatContext implementation and state management
   - Verify button rendering in ChatMessages and related components
   - Compare with pre-refactoring implementation to identify differences
   - Add tests to verify button display functionality

After addressing the regression, the next phase will focus on implementing higher-risk backend improvements:

1. **Implement SQLAlchemy ORM**
   - Set up SQLAlchemy configuration
   - Create model classes for database tables
   - Update services to use SQLAlchemy models
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Verify all functionality works as before

2. **Improve route organization**
   - Convert route functions to class-based views
   - Group related routes under the same blueprint
   - Add method-level documentation
   - Apply decorators for common functionality
