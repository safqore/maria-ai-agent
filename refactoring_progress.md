# Refactoring Progress: Phase 1 - Setup and Preparation

This document tracks the progress of the Maria AI Agent refactoring project.

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Completed)

### 1. Set up linting and formatting
- ✅ Added ESLint and Prettier for frontend TypeScript/React code
- ✅ Added Black, isort, and flake8 for backend Python code
- ✅ Created configuration files (.eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, pyproject.toml, .flake8)
- ✅ Added scripts to package.json for linting and formatting
- ✅ Created Makefile with common development commands
- ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code quality checks
- ✅ Fixed ESLint/Prettier dependency conflicts (updated package.json and configurations)
- ✅ Fixed pre-commit config YAML syntax for TypeScript ESLint packages
- ✅ Updated pre-commit config with compatible Prettier version
- ✅ Fixed locale settings for consistent development environment:
  - Added git wrapper script (`run-git.sh`) to set correct locale
  - Added git commands to Makefile with proper locale settings
  - Added .gitconfig with locale environment variables

### 2. Improve documentation
- ✅ Added comprehensive docstrings to key backend files:
  - app/__init__.py
  - app/routes/session.py
  - app/routes/upload.py
  - wsgi.py
- ✅ Added JSDoc comments to key frontend files:
  - src/hooks/useSessionUUID.ts
  - src/utils/config.ts
  - src/App.tsx
  - src/state/FiniteStateMachine.ts
- ✅ Updated README.md with setup and development instructions

### 3. Prepare testing infrastructure
- ✅ Created testing plan (testing_plan.md)
- ✅ Updated Makefile with testing commands
- ✅ Added testing information to README.md
- ✅ Fixed Jest configuration and dependencies for frontend testing
- ✅ Added style mocks for CSS imports in tests

## Next Phase: Backend Improvements - Lower Risk

The next phase will focus on implementing the service layer pattern in the backend:

1. **Create service layer**
   - Create services directory
   - Move business logic from routes to service classes
   - Update route handlers to use the service classes
   - Add comprehensive type hints
   - Verify all tests pass

2. **Implement centralized error handling**
   - Create error handler utility
   - Define custom exception classes
   - Register error handlers with Flask app
   - Update routes to use the api_route decorator

3. **Add request validation**
   - Install Marshmallow
   - Create schema definitions
   - Update route handlers to use schemas
   - Implement appropriate error responses
