# Refactoring Progress: Phase 1 - Setup and Preparation

This document tracks the progress of the Maria AI Agent refactoring project.

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Completed)

### 1. Set up linting and formatting
- ✅ Added ESLint and Prettier for frontend TypeScript/React code
- ✅ Added Black, isort, and flake8 for backend Python code
- ✅ Created configuration files (.eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, pyproject.toml, .flake8)
- ✅ Added scripts to package.json for linting and formatting
- ✅ Created Makefile with common development commands
- ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code quality checks
- ✅ Fixed ESLint/Prettier dependency conflicts (updated package.json and configurations)
- ✅ Fixed pre-commit config YAML syntax for TypeScript ESLint packages
- ✅ Updated pre-commit config with compatible Prettier version
- ✅ Fixed locale settings for consistent development environment:
  - Added git wrapper script (`run-git.sh`) to set correct locale
  - Added git commands to Makefile with proper locale settings
  - Added .gitconfig with locale environment variables
- ✅ Fixed all linting and code quality issues:
  - Fixed line length issues in Python files
  - Removed unused imports in backend Python files
  - Reorganized imports in test files
  - Fixed empty functions, unused variables, and type issues in frontend code
  - Verified all pre-commit hooks pass successfully

### 2. Improve documentation
- ✅ Added comprehensive docstrings to key backend files:
  - app/__init__.py
  - app/routes/session.py
  - app/routes/upload.py
  - wsgi.py
- ✅ Added JSDoc comments to key frontend files:
  - src/hooks/useSessionUUID.ts
  - src/utils/config.ts
  - src/App.tsx
  - src/state/FiniteStateMachine.ts
- ✅ Updated README.md with setup and development instructions

### 3. Prepare testing infrastructure
- ✅ Created testing plan (testing_plan.md)
- ✅ Updated Makefile with testing commands
- ✅ Added testing information to README.md
- ✅ Fixed Jest configuration and dependencies for frontend testing
- ✅ Added style mocks for CSS imports in tests
- ✅ Created backend/tests/conftest.py for shared test fixtures
- ✅ Fixed test import organization to follow best practices

## Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Next Phase

✅ All Phase 1 objectives have been completed
✅ All linting and code quality checks pass
✅ Code can now be committed to Git without errors

## Phase 2: Backend Improvements - Lower Risk (Completed)

1. **Create service layer** ✅
   - ✅ Created services directory
   - ✅ Moved business logic from routes to service classes (SessionService and UploadService)
   - ✅ Updated route handlers to use the service classes
   - ✅ Added comprehensive type hints
   - ✅ Verified all tests pass

2. **Implement centralized error handling** ✅
   - ✅ Created error handler utility (app/errors.py)
   - ✅ Defined custom exception classes (APIError, InvalidRequestError, etc.)
   - ✅ Registered error handlers with Flask app
   - ✅ Updated routes to use the api_route decorator
   - ✅ Replaced manual error handling with exceptions

3. **Add request validation** ✅
   - ✅ Installed Marshmallow
   - ✅ Created schema definitions (app/schemas directory)
   - ✅ Updated route handlers to use schemas
   - ✅ Implemented appropriate error responses

## Phase 2 Complete - Ready for Next Phase

✅ All Phase 2 objectives have been completed
✅ All tests pass
✅ Application functionality remains intact
✅ Frontend builds successfully with strict ESLint rules
✅ Backend API structure follows best practices with proper separation of concerns

## Next Phase: Frontend Improvements - Lower Risk

The next phase will focus on implementing frontend improvements:

1. **Create API service layer**
   - Create API directory with configuration
   - Implement separate API modules for different features (session, chat, file)
   - Replace direct fetch calls with API service methods
   - Update error handling and response processing

2. **Refactor custom hooks**
   - Improve error handling in hooks
   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Implement better caching strategies
   - Update components that use these hooks

3. **Break down large components**
   - Identify components with multiple responsibilities
   - Split them into smaller, focused components
   - Create proper interfaces for component props
   - Update imports and usages
