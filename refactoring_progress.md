# Refactoring Progress: Phase 1 - Setup and Preparation

This document tracks the progress of the Maria AI Agent refactoring project.

## Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Completed)

### 1. Set up linting and formatting
- ✅ Added ESLint and Prettier for frontend TypeScript/React code
- ✅ Added Black, isort, and flake8 for backend Python code
- ✅ Created configuration files (.eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, pyproject.toml, .flake8)
- ✅ Added scripts to package.json for linting and formatting
- ✅ Created Makefile with common development commands
- ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code quality checks
- ✅ Fixed ESLint/Prettier dependency conflicts (updated package.json and configurations)
- ✅ Fixed pre-commit config YAML syntax for TypeScript ESLint packages
- ✅ Updated pre-commit config with compatible Prettier version
- ✅ Fixed locale settings for consistent development environment:
  - Added git wrapper script (`run-git.sh`) to set correct locale
  - Added git commands to Makefile with proper locale settings
  - Added .gitconfig with locale environment variables
- ✅ Fixed all linting and code quality issues:
  - Fixed line length issues in Python files
  - Removed unused imports in backend Python files
  - Reorganized imports in test files
  - Fixed empty functions, unused variables, and type issues in frontend code
  - Verified all pre-commit hooks pass successfully

### 2. Improve documentation
- ✅ Added comprehensive docstrings to key backend files:
  - app/__init__.py
  - app/routes/session.py
  - app/routes/upload.py
  - wsgi.py
- ✅ Added JSDoc comments to key frontend files:
  - src/hooks/useSessionUUID.ts
  - src/utils/config.ts
  - src/App.tsx
  - src/state/FiniteStateMachine.ts
- ✅ Updated README.md with setup and development instructions

### 3. Prepare testing infrastructure
- ✅ Created testing plan (testing_plan.md)
- ✅ Updated Makefile with testing commands
- ✅ Added testing information to README.md
- ✅ Fixed Jest configuration and dependencies for frontend testing
- ✅ Added style mocks for CSS imports in tests
- ✅ Created backend/tests/conftest.py for shared test fixtures
- ✅ Fixed test import organization to follow best practices

## Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Next Phase

✅ All Phase 1 objectives have been completed
✅ All linting and code quality checks pass
✅ Code can now be committed to Git without errors

## Phase 2: Backend Improvements - Lower Risk (Completed)

1. **Create service layer** ✅
   - ✅ Created services directory
   - ✅ Moved business logic from routes to service classes (SessionService and UploadService)
   - ✅ Updated route handlers to use the service classes
   - ✅ Added comprehensive type hints
   - ✅ Verified all tests pass

2. **Implement centralized error handling** ✅
   - ✅ Created error handler utility (app/errors.py)
   - ✅ Defined custom exception classes (APIError, InvalidRequestError, etc.)
   - ✅ Registered error handlers with Flask app
   - ✅ Updated routes to use the api_route decorator
   - ✅ Replaced manual error handling with exceptions

3. **Add request validation** ✅
   - ✅ Installed Marshmallow
   - ✅ Created schema definitions (app/schemas directory)
   - ✅ Updated route handlers to use schemas
   - ✅ Implemented appropriate error responses

## Phase 2 Complete - Ready for Next Phase

✅ All Phase 2 objectives have been completed
✅ All tests pass
✅ Application functionality remains intact
✅ Frontend builds successfully with strict ESLint rules
✅ Backend API structure follows best practices with proper separation of concerns

## Phase 3: Frontend Improvements - Lower Risk (Completed)

1. **Create API service layer** ✅
   - ✅ Created API directory with configuration
   - ✅ Implemented separate API modules for different features (session, chat, file)
   - ✅ Created centralized error handling for API calls
   - ✅ Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API responses

2. **Refactor custom hooks** ✅
   - ✅ Improved error handling in useSessionUUID hook
   - ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces
   - ✅ Added resetSession functionality
   - ✅ Updated implementation to use new API service
   - ✅ Created useChatApi hook for chat-related API operations
   - ✅ Implemented useApiRequest hook for standardized API request handling

3. **Break down large components** ✅
   - ✅ Split FileUpload component into smaller components:
     - FileUploadButton for file selection
     - FileStatusItem for individual file status
     - FileStatusList for managing multiple files
   - ✅ Split ChatContainer into smaller components:
     - ChatMessages for rendering messages
     - ChatControls for handling user input
     - ChatActions for contextual actions like file upload
   - ✅ Created feature-based directory structure for components
   - ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - ✅ Created comprehensive tests for all new components
   - ✅ Updated imports in existing components

4. **Implement consistent error handling** ✅
   - ✅ Created ErrorBoundary component for handling component errors
   - ✅ Implemented centralized error handling in API services
   - ✅ Added error states and handling in hooks
   - ✅ Updated components to use consistent error handling patterns

5. **Improve state management** ✅
   - ✅ Created ChatContext for centralized chat state management
   - ✅ Created FileUploadContext for file upload state
   - ✅ Implemented context providers with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - ✅ Created adapter hooks to bridge old and new state management patterns
   - ✅ Added comprehensive tests for contexts and state management

## Phase 3 Complete - Ready for Next Phase

✅ All Phase 3 objectives have been completed
✅ All tests pass
✅ Application functionality remains intact
✅ Frontend code is now more maintainable with better separation of concerns
✅ Error handling is consistent across the application
✅ Documentation has been updated to reflect the new architecture

## Next Phase: Backend Improvements - Higher Risk

The next phase will focus on implementing higher-risk backend improvements:

1. **Implement SQLAlchemy ORM**
   - Set up SQLAlchemy configuration
   - Create model classes for database tables
   - Update services to use SQLAlchemy models
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Verify all functionality works as before

2. **Improve route organization**
   - Convert route functions to class-based views
   - Group related routes under the same blueprint
   - Add method-level documentation
   - Apply decorators for common functionality
