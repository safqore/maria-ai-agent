# Next Steps for Maria AI Agent Refactoring

## Phase 5: Context and Global State Refinements

Now that all components have been individually refactored, it's time to focus on global state management and overall application structure.

### Step 1: Finalize ChatContext and Adapters (June 26, 2025)

1. **Consolidate Context Interfaces**
   - [ ] Review all context types and interfaces for consistency
   - [ ] Add proper JSDoc documentation to all interfaces
   - [ ] Ensure all methods have proper TypeScript return types
   - [ ] Add unit tests for all context-related logic

2. **Improve State Machine Integration**
   - [ ] Create proper adapter layer between state machine and contexts
   - [ ] Ensure FSM state changes trigger appropriate context updates
   - [ ] Document the relationship between FSM states and UI changes
   - [ ] Add visualization of state transitions for development use

3. **Optimize Context Performance**
   - [ ] Use React.memo for components that only read from context
   - [ ] Split context if needed to avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - [ ] Implement useMemo for complex derived state
   - [ ] Add performance measurements to ensure efficiency

### Step 2: Add Data Fetching Layer (June 27, 2025)

1. **Create API Data-Fetching System**
   - [ ] Implement proper loading states in contexts
   - [ ] Add request cancellation for network requests
   - [ ] Create standardized error handling for API responses
   - [ ] Make API endpoints configurable via environment variables

2. **Session Management Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement proper session restoration logic
   - [ ] Add automatic session expiration handling
   - [ ] Ensure all API calls include proper session headers
   - [ ] Create a retry mechanism for failed requests

### Step 3: Cross-cutting Concerns (June 27, 2025)

1. **Logging and Analytics**
   - [ ] Implement proper error logging
   - [ ] Add user interaction analytics
   - [ ] Create performance monitoring hooks
   - [ ] Ensure all logs are properly anonymized

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - [ ] Run a comprehensive accessibility audit
   - [ ] Ensure proper keyboard navigation
   - [ ] Verify screen reader compatibility
   - [ ] Add proper focus management

### Step 4: Final Integration and Testing (June 28, 2025)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive E2E tests with Cypress
   - [ ] Test all critical user flows
   - [ ] Add visual regression tests
   - [ ] Create automated performance benchmarks

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - [ ] Update component API documentation
   - [ ] Create architectural diagrams
   - [ ] Document state management patterns
   - [ ] Add setup instructions for new developers

## Timeline

- **June 26, 2025:** Complete context refinements and state machine integration
- **June 27, 2025:** Implement data fetching layer and cross-cutting concerns
- **June 28, 2025:** Finalize testing and documentation
- **June 30, 2025:** Complete review and preparation for release

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered complete when:

1. All components use the context system properly
2. Type safety is ensured throughout the application
3. All tests pass with good coverage
4. The application is fully accessible
5. Performance is at least as good as before refactoring
6. Code is well-documented and maintainable
