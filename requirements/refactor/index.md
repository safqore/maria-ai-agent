## Key Implementation Details - SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS

### SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation ‚úÖ
- Repository pattern with type-safe operations ‚úÖ
- Migration support with Alembic ‚úÖ
- Transaction management with context managers ‚úÖ
- 7 strategic performance indexes implemented ‚úÖ

### Blueprint Implementation ‚úÖ
- API versioning with Flask blueprints ‚úÖ
- Rate limiting with Redis storage backend ‚úÖ
- Middleware integration ‚úÖ
- Route organization by feature ‚úÖ

### Transaction Management ‚úÖ
- TransactionContext for atomic operations ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Integration with repository pattern ‚úÖ
- Consistent error handling ‚úÖ

### Frontend State Refinements ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ChatContext and adapters ‚úÖ
- Finite State Machine for state management ‚úÖ
- React Context API integration ‚úÖ
- Error boundaries with correlation ID tracking ‚úÖ
- **ISSUES**: API client integration failures in tests

## Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

### Fixed During Review ‚úÖ
1. **TransactionContext Import**: Now properly exported from database package
2. **Session Service Validation**: All 24 tests passing consistently
3. **Frontend Endpoint Alignment**: Fixed `/persist-session` vs `/persist_session` mismatch
4. **XMLHttpRequest Mocking**: Added missing `getResponseHeader` method

### Remaining Issues (25% of work) üî¥
1. **Frontend API Client Integration**: Multiple test failures due to mocking issues
2. **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL authentication failures blocking performance tests
3. **Blueprint Middleware Registration**: Conflicts preventing clean test runs
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Mixed success rates across test suites
