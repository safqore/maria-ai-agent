# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the refactoring project that has successfully modernized the Maria AI Agent architecture.

## Documentation Files

- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Project overview, architecture, and technical implementation details
- **[STATUS.md](./STATUS.md)** - Current implementation status, testing strategies, and next steps

## Documentation Consolidation

This documentation has been simplified from 6 verbose files to 2 focused files while preserving all key technical information:

**Preserved Technical Details:**
- Architectural decisions and rationale (lazy loading, linear backoff, etc.)
- Implementation patterns (repository pattern, transaction management, etc.)
- Testing strategies and infrastructure details
- Performance considerations and optimization approaches
- Environment configuration specifics
- API design patterns and middleware implementation
- Session management and UUID collision handling specifics

**Removed:** Inflated metrics, repetitive content, and unverifiable progress claims

## Quick Start

1. **Review Implementation**: See `README.md` for what's been implemented and technical details
2. **Check Status**: See `STATUS.md` for current state, testing approach, and next steps
3. **Run Tests**: Execute `make test` to validate current functionality

## Key Achievements

The refactoring has successfully implemented:
- SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern
- Flask blueprints with API versioning
- React Context state management
- Service layer architecture
- File upload with S3 integration
- Authentication and middleware systems
- Transaction management with collision handling
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Environment Setup

**Critical**: Activate conda environment before backend operations:
```bash
conda activate maria-ai-agent
```

For detailed information, see the main documentation files above.
