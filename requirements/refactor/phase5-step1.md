# Phase 5: Context and Global State Refinements

This directory contains documentation for Phase 5 of the Maria AI Agent refactoring project, focused on Context and Global State management improvements.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enhanced Chat State Machine Adapter (June 26, 2025)

The following enhancements have been implemented:

1. **Improved ChatStateMachineAdapter**
   - Added proper TypeScript interface for adapter return values
   - Added functionality to synchronize FSM state with Context
   - Implemented missing methods: `getCurrentState`, `canTransition`, `performTransition`, `reset`
   - Enhanced dependency handling in lifecycle hooks
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation

2. **Optimized Components**
   - Enhanced ChatMessage component with custom React.memo comparison function
   - Added tests for optimization verification

3. **Development Tools**
   - Created FsmVisualizer component for state machine debugging
   - Added comprehensive FSM documentation (README-fsm.md)

## Next Steps

The upcoming tasks for Phase 5 include:

1. **Add Data Fetching Layer (June 27, 2025)**
   - Implement proper loading states in contexts
   - Make API endpoints configurable via environment variables
   - Add session restoration logic
   - Create retry mechanisms for failed requests

2. **Cross-cutting Concerns (June 27, 2025)**
   - Implement proper error logging
   - Add user interaction analytics
   - Ensure all logs are properly anonymized
   - Improve accessibility

## Testing

To verify these changes, ensure:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests for the adapter functionality pass
- FSM state transitions work correctly
- Components respond appropriately to state changes

## Documentation

- See [README-fsm.md](../README-fsm.md) for details on the Finite State Machine implementation
- See adapter code for TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc documentation
