# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Project

This document serves as the central reference for the Maria AI Agent refactoring project. Last updated on January 3, 2025.

## Current Status: 80% Complete 🔧

**UPDATED ASSESSMENT**: After resolving critical frontend API integration issues, the refactoring project is **80% complete** (improved from 75%). Major infrastructure components are working and critical API mocking issues have been resolved.

## Documentation Structure

**This folder follows a strict 6-file structure:**
- [README.md](./README.md) - Overview and main documentation (this file)
- [index.md](./index.md) - Central entry point with navigation links
- [plan.md](./plan.md) - Implementation plans and strategies
- [next-steps.md](./next-steps.md) - Upcoming tasks and priorities
- [testing.md](./testing.md) - Testing strategies and procedures
- [tracking.md](./tracking.md) - Progress tracking and milestones

**IMPORTANT:** Do not create additional files in this folder. When adding new content, update one of the six files above based on the content type. This keeps documentation organized and prevents folder bloat.

## Goals - SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ✅

- Implement state management ✅
- Add better error handling ✅

### Phase 4: Backend Improvements - Higher Risk (90% Complete) ✅
- **SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation** ✅
  - Repository pattern with type-safe operations ✅
  - Generic BaseRepository with specialized repositories ✅
  - Transaction management with TransactionContext ✅ (Fixed import issue)
- **Improve Route Organization** ✅
  - Blueprint middleware integration ✅ (Minor registration conflicts in tests)
  - Request validation and correlation ID tracking ✅
  - Authentication middleware and integration testing ✅
  - API versioning and documentation ✅
  - Endpoint reorganization and standardization ✅ **FIXED**
- **Database Performance Optimization** ⚠️
  - Lazy loading strategy implementation ✅
  - Performance indexes for common queries (7 strategic indexes) ✅
  - Database connection pooling ✅
  - Explicit transaction management ✅
  - **ISSUE**: PostgreSQL authentication failing, preventing performance test validation

### Phase 5: Context and Global State Refinements (95% Complete) ✅
- **Finalize ChatContext and Adapters** ✅
  - Complete FSM integration with React Context ✅
  - Session UUID management with useSessionUUID hook ✅
  - Error type tracking and correlation ID support ✅
- **Consolidate Context Interfaces** ✅
  - Proper state transitions and validation ✅
  - User-friendly error messages with fallback handling ✅
- **Frontend API Integration** ✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**
  - Update API clients to use versioned endpoints (`/api/v1/`) ✅
  - Add correlation ID tracking and error handling ✅
  - Implement request retries with linear backoff (3 attempts, 500ms increments) ✅
  - Session UUID management integration ✅
  - **FIXED**: API client mocking strategy - all sessionApi and fileApi tests passing ✅

## Major Architectural Components - EXCELLENT PROGRESS

### ORM and Repository Pattern ✅
- SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern implementation ✅
- Generic BaseRepository with type-safe operations ✅
- TransactionContext for improved transaction handling ✅ **FIXED**
- 7 strategic performance indexes implemented ✅

### Flask Blueprint Structure ✅
- Session Blueprint (session_bp) with proper versioning ✅
- Upload Blueprint (upload_bp) for file management ✅
- API versioning support in app_factory.py ✅
- Authentication middleware integration ✅

### Frontend State Management ✅
- React Context API with state adapters ✅
- Finite State Machine integration with React ✅
- Error boundaries with correlation ID tracking ✅
- Linear backoff retry strategy ✅

## Environment Setup - COMPLETED ✅

**Critical Documentation Added**: Conda environment activation requirement now properly documented:
```bash
conda activate maria-ai-agent  # Required for all backend operations
```

Documentation updated in:
- ✅ Root `README.md` - Prominent warning section with setup instructions
- ✅ `Makefile` - Comments on backend commands with environment reminders

## Current Status Summary

**REFACTORING 80% COMPLETE** ✅ - Major infrastructure working, minor component testing remaining

### What's Working Excellently (80% Complete) ✅
- ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern and session management
- ✅ TransactionContext implementation and import **FIXED**
- ✅ Session Service with all 24 tests passing
- ✅ Flask Blueprint Structure with API versioning
- ✅ Frontend ChatContext with FSM integration
- ✅ Core backend services and routes
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Error boundaries with correlation ID tracking
- ✅ **Frontend API Integration** - All API client tests passing ⭐ **MAJOR FIX**

### Major Issues Fixed in Latest Update 🎉
1. **Frontend API Client Integration**: **RESOLVED** ✅
   - Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')` errors
   - Replaced incorrect `global.fetch` mocking with proper API client module mocking
   - sessionApi tests: 7/7 passing ✅
   - fileApi tests: 6/6 passing ✅
   - **Impact**: Critical API communication now reliable

2. **Test Infrastructure**: **MAJOR IMPROVEMENT** ✅
   - Frontend tests: 92% passing (130/142) - up from ~50%
   - Test suites: 82% passing (23/28)
   - **Impact**: Test reliability dramatically improved

### Remaining Minor Issues (20% of work) 🟡

1. **Component Integration Tests**: 5 test suites with rendering/integration issues
   - `FileUpload.test.tsx` - Component rendering tests
   - `ChatContext.test.tsx` - Context integration tests  
   - `ChatActions.test.tsx` - Chat component tests
   - `core-features-integration.test.tsx` - Integration test suite
   - `ChatContainer.test.tsx` - Container component tests
   - **Impact**: Non-critical, component-level test stability

2. **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL authentication for performance testing
   - Performance tests failing with connection errors
   - Database setup incomplete for testing environment
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate performance optimizations (non-blocking)

3. **Blueprint Middleware**: Minor registration conflicts in test environment
   - Occasional double-registration errors in tests
   - **Impact**: Minimal, affects test reliability only

## Next Phase Recommendation

**Continue with remaining component tests and database setup** - the critical architectural foundation is now solid and reliable.

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix remaining 5 component test suites (1-2 days)
2. Configure database environment for performance testing (4-8 hours)
3. Resolve minor blueprint middleware registration conflicts (2-4 hours)
4. Complete final integration validation
