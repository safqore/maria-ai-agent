# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Project

This document serves as the central reference for the Maria AI Agent refactoring project. Last updated on January 3, 2025.

## Current Status: 75% Complete 🔧

**CORRECTED ASSESSMENT**: After comprehensive codebase testing and validation, the refactoring project is **75% complete**, not 98% as previously documented. While major infrastructure components exist, significant integration and testing work remains.

## Documentation Structure

**This folder follows a strict 6-file structure:**
- [README.md](./README.md) - Overview and main documentation (this file)
- [index.md](./index.md) - Central entry point with navigation links
- [plan.md](./plan.md) - Implementation plans and strategies
- [next-steps.md](./next-steps.md) - Upcoming tasks and priorities
- [testing.md](./testing.md) - Testing strategies and procedures
- [tracking.md](./tracking.md) - Progress tracking and milestones

**IMPORTANT:** Do not create additional files in this folder. When adding new content, update one of the six files above based on the content type. This keeps documentation organized and prevents folder bloat.

## Goals - SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ✅

- ✅ Improve code organization, maintainability, and adherence to best practices
- ⚠️ Make the codebase more extendable and easier to understand for future development (partially achieved)
- ⚠️ Maintain functional behavior throughout the refactoring process (some test failures remain)

## Implementation Phases - MIXED PROGRESS

### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Weeks 1-2) ✅
- Set up linting and formatting ✅
- Improve documentation ✅
- Prepare testing infrastructure ✅

### Phase 2: Backend Improvements - Lower Risk (Weeks 3-5) ✅
- Create service layer ✅
- Implement centralized error handling ✅
- Add request validation ✅

### Phase 3: Frontend Improvements - Lower Risk (Weeks 6-8) ✅
- Refactor component structure ✅
- Implement state management ✅
- Add better error handling ✅

### Phase 4: Backend Improvements - Higher Risk (75% Complete) ⚠️
- **SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation** ✅
  - Repository pattern with type-safe operations ✅
  - Generic BaseRepository with specialized repositories ✅
  - Transaction management with TransactionContext ✅ (Fixed import issue)
- **Improve Route Organization** ⚠️
  - Blueprint middleware integration ⚠️ (Registration conflicts in tests)
  - Request validation and correlation ID tracking ✅
  - Authentication middleware and integration testing ✅
  - API versioning and documentation ✅
  - Endpoint reorganization and standardization ⚠️ (Frontend/backend mismatches)
- **Database Performance Optimization** ❌
  - Lazy loading strategy implementation ✅
  - Performance indexes for common queries (7 strategic indexes) ✅
  - Database connection pooling ✅
  - Explicit transaction management ✅
  - **ISSUE**: PostgreSQL authentication failing, preventing performance test validation

### Phase 5: Context and Global State Refinements (80% Complete) ⚠️
- **Finalize ChatContext and Adapters** ✅
  - Complete FSM integration with React Context ✅
  - Session UUID management with useSessionUUID hook ✅
  - Error type tracking and correlation ID support ✅
- **Consolidate Context Interfaces** ✅
  - Proper state transitions and validation ✅
  - User-friendly error messages with fallback handling ✅
- **Frontend API Integration** ⚠️
  - Update API clients to use versioned endpoints (`/api/v1/`) ✅
  - Add correlation ID tracking and error handling ✅
  - Implement request retries with linear backoff (3 attempts, 500ms increments) ✅
  - Session UUID management integration ✅
  - **ISSUES**: XMLHttpRequest mocking failures, API client test failures

## Major Architectural Components - SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS

### ORM and Repository Pattern ✅
- SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern implementation ✅
- Generic BaseRepository with type-safe operations ✅
- TransactionContext for improved transaction handling ✅ **FIXED**
- 7 strategic performance indexes implemented ✅

### Flask Blueprint Structure ✅
- Session Blueprint (session_bp) with proper versioning ✅
- Upload Blueprint (upload_bp) for file management ✅
- API versioning support in app_factory.py ✅
- Authentication middleware integration ✅

### Frontend State Management ✅
- React Context API with state adapters ✅
- Finite State Machine integration with React ✅
- Error boundaries with correlation ID tracking ✅
- Linear backoff retry strategy ✅

## Environment Setup - COMPLETED ✅

**Critical Documentation Added**: Conda environment activation requirement now properly documented:
```bash
conda activate maria-ai-agent  # Required for all backend operations
```

Documentation updated in:
- ✅ Root `README.md` - Prominent warning section with setup instructions
- ✅ `Makefile` - Comments on backend commands with environment reminders

## Current Status Summary

**REFACTORING 75% COMPLETE** ⚠️ - Major infrastructure working, integration work needed

### What's Actually Working (75% Complete) ✅
- ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern and session management
- ✅ TransactionContext implementation and import **FIXED**
- ✅ Session Service with all 24 tests passing
- ✅ Flask Blueprint Structure with API versioning
- ✅ Frontend ChatContext with FSM integration
- ✅ Core backend services and routes
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Error boundaries with correlation ID tracking

### Critical Issues Fixed During Review 🔧
1. **TransactionContext Import**: **FIXED** - Now properly exported from database package
2. **Session Service Test**: **VERIFIED** - All 24 tests passing
3. **Frontend Endpoint Alignment**: **FIXED** - Corrected `/persist-session` vs `/persist_session` mismatch
4. **XMLHttpRequest Mocking**: **IMPROVED** - Added missing `getResponseHeader` method
5. **File Upload Test**: **FIXED** - Now correctly expects correlation ID

### Remaining Critical Issues (25% of work) 🔴

1. **Frontend API Client Integration**: Multiple test failures due to mocking issues
   - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')` errors in sessionApi tests
   - API client module not properly mocked
   - **Impact**: Frontend API communication unreliable

2. **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL authentication failures
   - Performance tests failing with connection errors
   - Database setup incomplete for testing environment
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate performance optimizations

3. **Blueprint Middleware**: Registration conflicts in test environment
   - Double-registration errors preventing clean test runs
   - Middleware setup conflicts between app instances
   - **Impact**: Integration testing reliability issues

4. **Test Infrastructure**: Mixed success rates across test suites
   - Frontend: 11 failed, 21 passed in API tests
   - Backend: Session service working, integration tests problematic
   - **Impact**: Cannot guarantee refactored code stability

## Next Phase Recommendation

**Continue refactoring with focus on integration and testing stability** rather than new features. The architecture is solid but needs debugging and proper test configuration.

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix frontend API client mocking and integration tests
2. Configure database environment for performance testing
3. Resolve blueprint middleware registration conflicts
4. Complete remaining endpoint alignment issues
