# Phase 5: Context and Global State Refinements

This document tracks the progress and implementation details for Phase 5 of the Maria AI Agent refactoring project, focused on improving Context and Global State management.

## Overview

Phase 5 aims to enhance the application's state management with improved TypeScript typing, better performance, and more maintainable code patterns. The work includes refining the Finite State Machine (FSM) integration, optimizing context usage, and adding proper data fetching mechanisms.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enhanced Chat State Machine Adapter (June 26, 2025)

The following enhancements have been implemented:

#### 1. Improved ChatStateMachineAdapter
- Added proper TypeScript interface for adapter return values
- Added functionality to synchronize FSM state with Context
- Implemented missing methods: `getCurrentState`, `canTransition`, `performTransition`, `reset`
- Enhanced dependency handling in lifecycle hooks
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation

#### 2. Optimized Components
- Enhanced ChatMessage component with custom React.memo comparison function
- Added tests for optimization verification

#### 3. Development Tools
- Created FsmVisualizer component for state machine debugging
- Added comprehensive FSM documentation (README-fsm.md)

#### Issues Fixed in Step 1
- **ChatContext.tsx**: Fixed block-scoped variables being used before declaration
  - Reorganized function declarations to ensure proper ordering
  - Moved `setInputDisabled`, `setButtonGroupVisible`, and `updateFsmState` earlier in the file
  - Resolved circular dependencies between functions

- **useChatStateMachineAdapter.ts**: Removed duplicate function declarations
  - Eliminated redundant declarations of `syncFsmState`, `getCurrentState`, `canTransition`, etc.
  - Improved code organization and readability

- **State Machine Transition Calls**: Standardized approach to FSM transitions
  - For timeouts in useEffect: Direct FSM calls to avoid circular dependencies
  - For handlers: Adapter methods for better encapsulation

- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments and clarified adapter pattern

## Next Steps

The upcoming tasks for Phase 5 include:

### Step 2: Add Data Fetching Layer (June 27, 2025)
- Implement proper loading states in contexts
- Make API endpoints configurable via environment variables
- Add session restoration logic
- Create retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Add request cancellation for network requests
- Create standardized error handling for API responses

### Step 3: Cross-cutting Concerns (June 27, 2025)
- Implement proper error logging
- Add user interaction analytics
- Ensure all logs are properly anonymized
- Improve accessibility
- Create performance monitoring hooks

## Testing

To verify these changes, ensure:
- All existing tests pass
- New tests for the adapter functionality pass
- FSM state transitions work correctly
- Components respond appropriately to state changes

## Documentation

- See [README-fsm.md](../README-fsm.md) for details on the Finite State Machine implementation
- See adapter code for TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc documentation

- `/src/components/ChatMessage.tsx` - Optimized component with React.memo

## Notes

- The enhanced ChatContext is designed to be used exclusively, replacing the previous approach
- Documentation for the FSM was created to ensure functional requirements aren't lost during refactoring
- All changes follow the incremental approach, with small, focused modifications that maintain application functionality
