# Progress Summary - June 27, 2025

This document summarizes today's accomplishments and outlines the next steps in our refactoring project.

## Today's Accomplishments

1. **Application Factory Consolidation** ✅
   - Consolidated app/__init__.py and app_factory.py to use a single application factory
   - Updated imports to use app_factory.py as the primary factory
   - Ensured all blueprints are registered with proper URL prefixes

2. **Import Path Consistency** ✅
   - Fixed inconsistent import paths throughout the codebase
   - Changed from relative imports (app.*) to absolute imports (backend.app.*)
   - Tested application creation successfully

3. **Documentation Updates** ✅
   - Updated tracking.md with current progress
   - Updated blueprint-implementation.md to reflect our changes
   - Created repository-enhancement.md to outline upcoming improvements
   - Updated current-tasks.md with completed and new tasks

4. **Repository Pattern Enhancements** ✅
   - Created working TransactionContext implementation for improved transaction management
   - Added standalone example demonstrating TransactionContext functionality
   - Documented transaction context implementation and usage patterns
   - Created transaction-implementation.md with implementation details

## Challenges Addressed

1. Resolved conflicts between multiple application factory implementations
2. Fixed inconsistent import paths that were causing errors
3. Addressed codebase organization issues with better documentation

## Next Steps (June 28-30, 2025)

### Priority 1: Complete Repository Pattern Enhancements

1. Integrate the standalone TransactionContext with the BaseRepository class
2. Resolve circular import issues by reorganizing database-related modules
3. Update services to use the improved repository pattern
4. Add integration tests for the repository pattern

### Priority 2: Complete Upload Blueprint Implementation

1. Finalize the upload blueprint with proper middleware and documentation
2. Update tests for blueprint-based routes
3. Verify all endpoints work with API versioning

### Priority 3: Continue Backend Documentation

1. Add more detailed API documentation with OpenAPI specifications
2. Update architectural diagrams to reflect the new blueprint structure
3. Create documentation for repository pattern usage

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Breaking changes from import path modifications
   **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of all routes and services

2. **Risk**: Session management issues with the repository pattern
   **Mitigation**: Standalone testing of transaction context completed; integrate incrementally

3. **Risk**: Circular imports when integrating TransactionContext
   **Mitigation**: Follow the standalone example approach to avoid circular dependencies

4. **Risk**: Blueprint migration affecting existing functionality
   **Mitigation**: Incremental changes with verification at each step

## Next Meeting Topics

1. Review of completed Phase 4 backend improvements
2. Planning for Phase 6 Security and Performance enhancements
3. Discussion of timeline adjustments if needed
