# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Progress Summary

Last updated: June 30, 2025

## Overall Progress: ~70% Complete

### Completed Tasks âœ…

#### Backend Improvements:
- SQLAlchemy ORM implementation with repository pattern
- Blueprint middleware integration
- Authentication middleware enhancements
- Request validation and correlation ID tracking
- API versioning with header support
- Error handling standardization
- Database transaction management with TransactionContext
- Authentication integration tests

#### Frontend Improvements:
- API client implementation with:
  - Versioned endpoints
  - Correlation ID tracking
  - Request retry with linear backoff
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Performance tracking and logging
- Updated all API service implementations to use the new client
- Integrated ChatContext with the new API client:
  - Added error type tracking and correlation ID support
  - Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Fixed TypeScript integration with the Finite State Machine

### Remaining Tasks ðŸ”„

#### Highest Priority:
- Fix any regression test issues:
  - Addressed TypeScript errors in ChatContext related to FSM integration
  - Updated Message interface to better support state transitions
1. **Context Integration** (Frontend)
   - Update ChatContext to handle API responses properly
   - Add error states and loading states
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add correlation ID tracking in context

2. **Database Optimization** (Backend)
   - Implement lazy loading as default for SQLAlchemy relationships
   - Add indexes for common query patterns
   - Optimize complex queries
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Integrate TransactionContext with all services

#### Medium Priority:
3. **Complete Endpoint Reorganization**
   - Finalize API endpoint organization
   - Ensure consistent error response formats
   - Update API documentation

#### Lower Priority:
4. **Integration Tests for API Endpoints**
   - Create comprehensive integration tests for session endpoints
   - Create integration tests for upload endpoints

## Estimated Timeline

- **ChatContext Integration**: 1-2 days
- **Database Optimization**: 3-4 days
- **Endpoint Reorganization**: 2-3 days
- **Integration Tests**: 2-3 days

Total estimated time to completion: ~8-12 days (by July 12, 2025)

## Next Action Items

1. Update ChatContext to handle API responses and errors
2. Implement error boundaries for API failures
3. Add loading states for API requests
4. Configure lazy loading for SQLAlchemy relationships
5. Add database indexes for common query patterns
6. Integrate TransactionContext with all services

## Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered complete when:

1. All API endpoints are using the new versioned format
2. Frontend is correctly handling API responses, including errors and retries
3. Database performance has been optimized with proper lazy loading and indexing
4. All services are using explicit transaction management
5. Test coverage is maintained at 80% or higher
6. Documentation is updated to reflect all architectural changes
