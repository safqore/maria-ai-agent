# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Tracking

This document serves as a real-time progress tracker for the Maria AI Agent refactoring project, documenting the latest status updates, blockers, and decisions. Last updated on June 28, 2025.

## Latest Status (June 28, 2025)

### Current Phase: Phase 4 (Backend Improvements - Higher Risk)
We have successfully completed Step 1 of Phase 4 (SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation) and have made significant progress on Step 2 (Improve Route Organization). We have resolved the two critical blockers identified previously, enhanced the authentication middleware, and implemented improved request validation and correlation ID tracking.

### Critical Blockers (Resolved ✅)

1. **Import Path Issue (RESOLVED)** ✅
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
```
This error was resolved by updating all import statements in the test files to use the correct package structure with `backend.app` prefix.

2. **Flask-Limiter Storage Backend Warning (RESOLVED)** ✅
```
Using the in-memory storage for tracking rate limits as no storage was explicitly specified. This is not recommended for production use.
```
We've configured Redis as the persistent storage backend for rate limiting with proper fallback to in-memory storage for development environments when Redis is unavailable.

## Key Decisions

### June 28, 2025

- Decision to consolidate app_factory.py and __init__.py logic
- Decision to configure Redis as the storage backend for Flask-Limiter

### June 26, 2025
- Decision to use TransactionContext for all database operations
- Decision to implement repository factory pattern for consistency

### June 25, 2025
- Decision to use Alembic for migrations instead of raw SQL files
- Decision to implement generic BaseRepository with type parameters

## Refactoring Documentation Progress

- Consolidated documentation into six core files
- Created comprehensive implementation guides
- Updated test documentation with examples
- Added transaction management documentation

## Next Actions

1. Complete the implementation of API documentation for all endpoints
2. Add OpenAPI/Swagger integration for interactive API documentation
3. Fully integrate TransactionContext with all service methods
4. Create database optimization examples (indexes, eager loading)
5. Implement correlation ID tracking across all API calls
6. Create integration tests for new middleware components
7. Document authentication system and API key management

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement lazy loading for SQLAlchemy relationships?
2. What is the best strategy for handling database connection pooling?
3. Should we add more granular rate limiting per endpoint or user?
4. What approach should we take for handling database migrations in production?
5. Should we use Redis or another storage backend for Flask-Limiter in production?

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Import structure issues | High | High | Fix package structure, ensure consistent imports |
| Database migration issues | Medium | High | Test migrations thoroughly, have rollback plan |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Benchmark before/after, optimize as needed |
| API incompatibility | Low | High | Maintain version compatibility, document changes |
| Rate limiting failures | Medium | Medium | Configure persistent storage for limiter, implement fallback mechanism |

## Progress Against Timeline

| Phase | Original Plan | Current Status | Deviation |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Phase 1: Setup | Weeks 1-2 | Completed | On time |
| Phase 2: Backend (Low Risk) | Weeks 3-5 | Completed | On time |
| Phase 3: Frontend (Low Risk) | Weeks 6-8 | Completed | On time |
| Phase 4: Backend (High Risk) | Weeks 9-12 | In progress (Week 10) | On time |
| Phase 5: State Refinements | Weeks 11-12 | In progress (Week 10) | Ahead of schedule |
