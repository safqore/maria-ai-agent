# Ma### Latest Status (June 30, 2025)

### Current Phase: Phase 4 (Backend Improvements - Higher Risk) and Phase 5 (Context and Global State Refinements)
We have successfully completed Step 1 of Phase 4 (SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation) and have made significant progress on Step 2 (Improve Route Organization). We have resolved the two critical blockers identified previously, enhanced the authentication middleware, implemented improved request validation and correlation ID tracking, and integrated middleware consistently across all blueprints.

### Frontend API Integration Progress
We have implemented a comprehensive API client with versioned endpoints, correlation ID tracking, request retry with linear backoff, enhanced error handling, and performance tracking. The client has been integrated with all existing API services (SessionApi, FileApi, ChatApi) and the ChatContext component. We've also fixed TypeScript errors in the integration between the ChatContext and the Finite State Machine. This addresses the highest priority items from our next steps.

### Implementation Strategy Update
Based on team discussion, we have decided to prioritize functional requirements over integration tests. This means we will focus on implementing the Frontend API Integration and Database Optimization work before completing the remaining integration tests. This approach will deliver more user-facing value sooner while still ensuring the core infrastructure has good test coverage.Agent Refactoring Tracking

### Critical Blockers (Resolved ✅)

1. **Import Path Issue (RESOLVED)** ✅
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
```
This error was resolved by updating all import statements in the test files to use the correct package structure with `backend.app` prefix.

2. **Flask-Limiter Storage Backend Warning (RESOLVED)** ✅
```
Using the in-memory storage for tracking rate limits as no storage was explicitly specified. This is not recommended for production use.
```
We've configured Redis as the persistent storage backend for rate limiting with proper fallback to in-memory storage for development environments when Redis is unavailable.
