# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Tracking

This document serves as a real-time progress tracker for the Maria AI Agent refactoring project, documenting the latest status updates, blockers, and decisions.

## Latest Status (June 27, 2025)

### Current Phase: Phase 4 (Backend Improvements - Higher Risk)
We have successfully completed Step 1 of Phase 4 (SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation) and have made significant progress on Step 2 (Improve Route Organization).

### Recent Accomplishments
- Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM with repository pattern ✅
  - Created generic BaseRepository with type-safe operations
  - Implemented UserSessionRepository with proper inheritance
  - Added factory pattern for repository instantiation
- Modified SessionService to work with the repository pattern ✅
- Enhanced database transaction management ✅
  - Created TransactionContext for improved transaction handling
  - Implemented standalone example with working tests
  - Documented usage patterns for integrating with repositories
- Created comprehensive documentation and test scripts ✅
  - Added test_orm.py and test_orm_simple.py for verification
  - Created sqlalchemy.md documentation
  - Updated orm-implementation.md with implementation details
  - Added transaction-implementation.md for TransactionContext documentation
- Implemented initial Flask blueprint structure ✅
  - Created session_bp with proper documentation and rate limiting
  - Drafted upload_bp structure in upload_blueprint.py
  - Updated app_factory.py to support API versioning
- Created app_factory.py with proper blueprint registration ✅
- Completed Phase 5 frontend improvements successfully ✅

### Blockers/Challenges
- Need to finalize upload route migration to blueprint structure
- ✅ Resolved conflicts between app/__init__.py and app/app_factory.py by consolidating on app_factory.py
- ✅ Fixed import path inconsistencies throughout the codebase
- Identified and created workaround for circular import issues in TransactionContext integration

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Participants |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| June 27, 2025 | Continue with app_factory.py as the primary application factory | Having two application factories (app/__init__.py and app/app_factory.py) causes confusion; standardize on app_factory.py with proper API versioning | Team |
| June 25, 2025 | Consolidated documentation into a single refactoring directory | Multiple separate files became difficult to manage; centralized documentation improves clarity | Team |
| June 20, 2025 | Adopted incremental approach for component refactoring | Initial large-scale refactoring caused regressions; incremental approach allows for better testing and verification | Dev Team |
| June 15, 2025 | Created adapter layer between state machine and context | Allows for gradual migration from FSM to React Context without breaking functionality | Tech Lead, Frontend Team |
| June 10, 2025 | Standardized API service layer for frontend | Improves maintainability and error handling consistency | Frontend Team |

## Current Priorities

1. Continue Phase 4 Backend Improvements
   - Complete upload blueprint implementation
   - Standardize on one application factory (app_factory.py)
   - Update application initialization (wsgi.py)
2. Add API versioning for all endpoints
3. Enhance route documentation with OpenAPI standard
4. Complete backend tests for the new blueprint structure
5. Plan for Phase 6 Security and Performance enhancements

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Duplicate application factories | High | Certain | Consolidate to a single app factory in app_factory.py |
| Inconsistent URL patterns | Medium | High | Apply consistent API versioning (/api/v1/...) |
| Regressions from blueprint migration | High | Medium | Comprehensive tests, gradual implementation |
| Performance degradation from context changes | Medium | Medium | Performance testing before/after changes, optimize render cycles |
| State management complexity during transition | Medium | High | Create adapter layer, thorough documentation of state transitions |
