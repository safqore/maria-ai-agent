# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Tracking

This document serves as a real-time progress tracker for the Maria AI Agent refactoring project, documenting the latest status updates, blockers, and decisions. Last updated on June 30, 2025.

## Latest Status (June 30, 2025)

### Current Phase: Phase 4 (Backend Improvements - Higher Risk) and Phase 5 (Context and Global State Refinements)
We have successfully completed Step 1 of Phase 4 (SQLAlchemy ORM Implementation) and have made significant progress on Step 2 (Improve Route Organization). We have resolved the two critical blockers identified previously, enhanced the authentication middleware, implemented improved request validation and correlation ID tracking, and integrated middleware consistently across all blueprints.

### Frontend API Integration Progress
We have implemented a comprehensive API client with versioned endpoints, correlation ID tracking, request retry with linear backoff, enhanced error handling, and performance tracking. The client has been integrated with all existing API services (SessionApi, FileApi, ChatApi) and the ChatContext component. We've also fixed TypeScript errors in the integration between the ChatContext and the Finite State Machine, including the empty test file structure in phase5-integration.test.tsx. This addresses the highest priority items from our next steps.

### Overall Progress: ~70% Complete

#### Completed Tasks âœ…

##### Backend Improvements:
- SQLAlchemy ORM implementation with repository pattern
- Blueprint middleware integration
- Authentication middleware enhancements
- Request validation and correlation ID tracking
- API versioning with header support
- Error handling standardization
- Database transaction management with TransactionContext
- Authentication integration tests

##### Frontend Improvements:
- API client implementation with:
  - Versioned endpoints
  - Correlation ID tracking
  - Request retry with linear backoff
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Performance tracking and logging
- Updated all API service implementations to use the new client
- Integrated ChatContext with the new API client:
  - Added error type tracking and correlation ID support
  - Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Fixed TypeScript integration with the Finite State Machine
  - Fixed empty test file structure in phase5-integration.test.tsx

#### Remaining Tasks ðŸ”„

##### Highest Priority:
1. **Context Integration** (Frontend)
   - Update ChatContext to handle API responses properly
   - Add error states and loading states
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add correlation ID tracking in context

2. **Database Optimization** (Backend)
   - Implement lazy loading as default for SQLAlchemy relationships
   - Add indexes for common query patterns
   - Optimize complex queries
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Integrate TransactionContext with all services

##### Estimated Timeline
- **ChatContext Integration**: 1-2 days
- **Database Optimization**: 3-4 days
- **Endpoint Reorganization**: 2-3 days
- **Integration Tests**: 2-3 days

Total estimated time to completion: ~8-12 days (by July 12, 2025)

### Implementation Strategy Update
Based on team discussion, we have decided to prioritize functional requirements over integration tests. This means we will focus on implementing the Frontend API Integration and Database Optimization work before completing the remaining integration tests. This approach will deliver more user-facing value sooner while still ensuring the core infrastructure has good test coverage.

### Success Criteria

The refactoring will be considered complete when:

1. All API endpoints are using the new versioned format
2. Frontend is correctly handling API responses, including errors and retries
3. Database performance has been optimized with proper lazy loading and indexing
4. All services are using explicit transaction management
5. Test coverage is maintained at 80% or higher
6. Documentation is updated to reflect all architectural changes.Agent Refactoring Tracking

### Critical Blockers (Resolved âœ…)

1. **Import Path Issue (RESOLVED)** âœ…
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
```
This error was resolved by updating all import statements in the test files to use the correct package structure with `backend.app` prefix.

2. **Flask-Limiter Storage Backend Warning (RESOLVED)** âœ…
```
Using the in-memory storage for tracking rate limits as no storage was explicitly specified. This is not recommended for production use.
```
We've configured Redis as the persistent storage backend for rate limiting with proper fallback to in-memory storage for development environments when Redis is unavailable.
