# Maria AI Agent Refactoring Tracking

This document serves as a real-time progress tracker for the Maria AI Agent refactoring project, documenting the latest status updates, blockers, and decisions.

## Latest Status (June 27, 2025)

### Current Phase: Phase 5 (Context and Global State Refinements)
Phase 5 objectives have been completed successfully, with all planned tasks implemented and working as expected.

### Recent Accomplishments
- Created data fetching system with TypeScript typing, loading states, and error handling (useFetch)
- Implemented session management improvements with useSessionManager
- Added centralized logging with performance tracking and error handling
- Created accessibility hooks for focus management and screen reader announcements
- Updated documentation to reflect the current status

### Blockers/Challenges
- None at present. All Phase 5 objectives have been met.

## Weekly Progress

### Week of June 23-27, 2025
- [x] Complete remaining Phase 3 tasks
- [x] Verify that all tests pass with the new component structure
- [x] Fix any remaining regressions in chat functionality
- [x] Begin work on Phase 5 Context and Global State refinements
- [x] Implement data fetching and session management improvements
- [x] Add logging and accessibility utilities
- [ ] Begin planning for Phase 4 Backend Improvements

### Week of June 16-20, 2025
- [x] Continued work on Component Refactoring
- [x] Fixed React 18 compatibility issues in hook tests
- [x] Improved test coverage for error handling scenarios
- [x] Fixed browser API mocks (XMLHttpRequest, scrollIntoView)

### Week of June 9-13, 2025
- [x] Created API directory with configuration
- [x] Implemented separate API modules for different features
- [x] Improved error handling in custom hooks
- [x] Added proper TypeScript types to hook parameters and returns

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Participants |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| June 25, 2025 | Consolidated documentation into a single refactoring directory | Multiple separate files became difficult to manage; centralized documentation improves clarity | Team |
| June 20, 2025 | Adopted incremental approach for component refactoring | Initial large-scale refactoring caused regressions; incremental approach allows for better testing and verification | Dev Team |
| June 15, 2025 | Created adapter layer between state machine and context | Allows for gradual migration from FSM to React Context without breaking functionality | Tech Lead, Frontend Team |
| June 10, 2025 | Standardized API service layer for frontend | Improves maintainability and error handling consistency | Frontend Team |

## Current Priorities

1. Begin Phase 4 Backend Improvements (Next week)
2. Implement SQLAlchemy ORM for data access
3. Improve backend route organization
4. Plan for Phase 6 Security and Performance enhancements

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Regressions in chat functionality | High | Medium | Comprehensive test suite, incremental changes with verification at each step |
| Performance degradation from context changes | Medium | Medium | Performance testing before/after changes, optimize render cycles |
| State management complexity during transition | Medium | High | Create adapter layer, thorough documentation of state transitions |
| Browser compatibility issues with new components | Medium | Low | Cross-browser testing, use established patterns from React ecosystem |
