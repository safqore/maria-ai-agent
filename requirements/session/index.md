This document serves as the main entry point for session management implementation in the Maria AI Agent project.

## Introduction

The session management system enables persistent user sessions, linking uploads with user conversations and providing a seamless experience across interactions. This feature addresses the need for associating uploaded files with specific users and maintaining contextual conversation history.

## Goals

- Create a robust session management system with unique identifiers
- Persist session data in a database with appropriate schema
- Associate uploaded files with specific user sessions
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Ensure secure handling of session data
- Provide smooth frontend integration

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Database Schema | Complete | SQL migration created and implemented |
| Session Service | Complete | Core functionality implemented with UUID validation and generation |
| API Endpoints | Complete | All routes established with validation, error handling, and rate limiting |
| Frontend Integration | In Progress | API service layer, session utilities, and hooks implemented; Context integration in progress |
| Audit Logging | Complete | Audit logging infrastructure in place for key events |
| File Association | In Progress | S3 namespacing with UUIDs implemented; orphaned file cleanup implemented |

## Current Focus

The current implementation focus is on:

1. Completing the Frontend SessionContext provider integration
2. Implementing comprehensive backend tests
3. Adding a session reset notification UI component
4. Enhancing the orphaned file cleanup mechanism
5. Improving error handling consistency between frontend and backend

## User Flow

1. User visits the application
   - System checks for existing session UUID in local storage
   - If not found, a new UUID is generated
2. User uploads files
   - Files are associated with the user's session ID
3. User interacts with the agent
   - All interactions are logged with the session ID
4. Session persistence
   - Session data is maintained across page refreshes
   - Long-term persistence via database storage

## Technical Design

The session management implementation follows a service-oriented architecture with clean separation between frontend and backend components:

### Backend Flow
```
API Request → Session Route → Session Service → Database
                     ↓
            Audit Logging Service
```

### Frontend Flow
```
Component → Session Context → useSessionUUID Hook → SessionApi → Backend
                                      ↓
                               localStorage (persistence)
```

### File Upload Flow with Session
```
File Upload Component → sessionUUID → Upload Service → S3 Storage (with UUID namespacing)
                                                            ↓
                                                    Orphaned File Cleanup
```
