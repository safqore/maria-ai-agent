## Blockers and Issues

| Issue | Impact | Resolution Plan | Status |
|-------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Frontend Context integration | Medium | Implement SessionContext provider and integrate with existing hooks | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |
| Backend test coverage | Medium | Implement comprehensive tests for session service and routes | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress |
| Frontend/Backend error handling coordination | Low | Ensure consistent error handling between frontend and backend | ðŸ”´ Open |
| Session reset UI integration | Medium | Add UI component for session reset notification | ï¿½ Open |

## Next Steps Priority

1. Complete SessionContext provider implementation and integration
2. Implement backend tests for session service and API routes
3. Add UI component for session reset notification
4. Enhance audit logging with more detailed events
5. Improve orphaned file cleanup with better error handling
