## Implementation Status: ✅ Ready for Implementation

**The Email Verification System documentation is 100% complete and ready for implementation as of December 2024.**

### Key Implementation Details

### Email Verification Flow Architecture

- **Email Format Validation**: Blocking validation - user cannot proceed until valid email format is entered
- **Verification Code Generation**: 6-digit numeric code with expiration
- **Attempt Management**: 3-attempt system with session reset on failure

### Chat Interface Integration

- **FSM Integration**: Additional states added to existing finite state machine for email verification flow
- **User Experience**: Blocking validation with clear error messaging
- **UI Enhancements**: Improved button positioning and messaging

### Security and Rate Limiting

- **Code Expiration**: 10-minute expiration for security
- **Rate Limiting**: 30-second cooldown between resend requests
- **Session Management**: Reuse existing session reset mechanism

### Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Email validation and code generation testing
- **Integration Tests**: Chat interface and FSM integration testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete email verification workflow testing
