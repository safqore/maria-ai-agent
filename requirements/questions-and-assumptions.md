- Update answers/status as they are resolved.
- Remove items that are no longer relevant or have been superseded.
- Keep this file focused on the present state of the projectâ€”do not use it as a historical log.
- Organize by feature/area for clarity.

### Questions

| #   | Question                                              | Answer/Status                                                                               | Notes                                        |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | How is a session started and tracked?                 | A session starts when the frontend generates a UUID (if not in localStorage).               | See README.md, plan.md                       |
| 2   | Where is the session UUID stored?                     | In both localStorage and React state for persistence across reloads.                        | README.md                                    |
| 3   | When is a session considered complete?                | Only after the user provides and verifies their email address.                              | README.md                                    |
| 4   | What happens if the UUID is missing or tampered with? | The frontend generates a new UUID and shows a reset message.                                | README.md, plan.md                           |
| 5   | How are incomplete sessions and their data handled?   | They are deleted if abandoned (including uploaded files).                                   | README.md                                    |
| 6   | How are orphaned files cleaned up?                    | Files in S3 with UUIDs not in the database and older than 30 minutes are deleted.           | README.md, plan.md                           |
| 7   | How is session reset communicated to the user?        | Via a modal and toast notification: "Your session has been reset due to a technical issue." | README.md, SessionContext, SessionResetModal |
| 8   | How is session security and privacy enforced?         | SSL/TLS, GDPR compliance, explicit consent, and user data controls.                         | README.md, plan.md                           |
| 9   | How is session UUID uniqueness enforced?              | Backend validates and retries up to 3 times on collision.                                   | plan.md, README.md                           |
| 10  | How is session state shared in the frontend?          | Through React Context and custom hooks (no props drilling).                                 | README.md, plan.md                           |
| 11  | How is session reset triggered programmatically?      | By removing the UUID from localStorage and generating a new one, then reloading the app.    | sessionUtils.ts, SessionContext              |
| 12  | How is session persistence tested?                    | With comprehensive backend and frontend tests, including edge cases and error scenarios.    | testing.md                                   |

### Assumptions

| 1   | What is the approach for SQLAlchemy relationship loading?   | Default to lazy loading, with eager loading used selectively for performance-critical paths.      | plan.md, sqlalchemy.md                |
| 2   | What strategy should be used for API retries?               | Linear backoff with a maximum of 3 retries, configurable by endpoint and error type.             | plan.md                               |
| 3   | How should correlation IDs be generated and maintained?     | Server-side generation with each request, passed to all downstream services and response headers. | plan.md, tracking.md                  |
| 4   | What error handling strategy should be implemented?         | Structured error responses with environment-based detail level and consistent error codes.        | errors.py, plan.md                    |

| 6   | What is the approach for frontend/backend integration?      | API-driven with clear contracts, separate deployment, and configuration-based endpoints.          | next-steps.md, plan.md                |
| 7   | How should application configuration be managed?            | Environment variables with sensible defaults, separate for frontend and backend.                  | config.py, frontend/.env              |
| 8   | What is the port configuration strategy?                    | Environment variables only, never hardcoded, with dynamic CORS configuration.                     | config.py, package.json               |
