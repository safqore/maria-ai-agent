# Phase 5: Context and Global State Refinements - Progress Report

## Step 1: Finalize ChatContext and Adapters (June 26, 2025)

### Completed Tasks:

#### 1. Consolidate Context Interfaces
- [x] Enhanced ChatContext with proper TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc documentation
- [x] Ensured all methods have proper TypeScript return types
- [x] Added missing context functions (setLoading, updateFsmState, handleButtonClick, sendMessage, resetChat)
- [x] Updated context reducer to handle all action types
- [x] Created unit tests for the enhanced ChatContext

#### 2. Improve State Machine Integration
- [x] Created proper adapter layer between state machine and contexts through useChatStateMachineAdapter
- [x] Ensured FSM state changes trigger appropriate context updates
- [x] Added getCurrentState and reset methods to the FSM interface
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation of the FSM in README-fsm.md
- [x] Added FsmVisualizer component for development use

#### 3. Optimize Context Performance
- [x] Created memoized ChatMessage component using React.memo
- [x] Implemented useMemo for complex derived state (button rendering)
- [x] Added unit tests to verify component behavior

### Next Steps:

1. Step 2: Add Data Fetching Layer (June 27, 2025)
   - Implement proper loading states in contexts
   - Add request cancellation for network requests
   - Create standardized error handling for API responses
   - Make API endpoints configurable via environment variables

2. Step 3: Cross-cutting Concerns (June 27, 2025)
   - Implement proper error logging
   - Add user interaction analytics
   - Create performance monitoring hooks
   - Ensure all logs are properly anonymized

## Notes:

- The enhanced ChatContext is designed to be used exclusively, replacing the previous approach
- Documentation for the FSM was created to ensure functional requirements aren't lost during refactoring
- The FsmVisualizer component provides a visual representation of FSM states and transitions for development
- ChatMessage component demonstrates performance optimization with React.memo and useMemo

All changes follow the incremental approach, with small, focused modifications that maintain application functionality while improving code quality and maintainability.
