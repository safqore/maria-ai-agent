I'll review the code refactoring requirements in the document and develop an implementation plan that follows an incremental approach. This way, we can ensure the application remains functional throughout the refactoring process.

## Requirements Analysis

The `code_refactor.md` document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for the Maria AI Agent project, focusing on both frontend and backend improvements. The main areas of refactoring include:

### Frontend
- Reorganizing folder structure to feature-based organization
- Improving state management (replacing custom FSM with React Context/useReducer)
- Creating centralized API service layer
- Refactoring custom hooks
- Breaking down large components
- Implementing consistent error handling

### Backend
- Implementing service layer pattern
- Replacing direct database connections with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Centralizing error handling
- Adding request validation with Marshmallow
- Improving route organization with class-based views

### General Improvements
- Adding comprehensive documentation
- Increasing test coverage
- Enforcing consistent code style with linting/formatting
- Enhancing security measures
- Optimizing performance

## Implementation Plan

I'll structure the implementation plan to start with the simplest changes first, verify functionality after each step, and then proceed to more complex changes.

### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Set up linting and formatting**
   - Frontend: ESLint and Prettier
   - Backend: Black, flake8, and isort
   - Add pre-commit hooks
   - Create script commands in package.json and Makefile

2. **Improve documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to frontend functions
   - Add Python docstrings to backend functions
   - Update README.md with setup and usage instructions

3. **Prepare testing infrastructure**
   - Set up test plans for critical functionality
   - Ensure existing tests run correctly
   - Document current behavior as acceptance criteria

### Phase 2: Backend Improvements - Lower Risk (Weeks 3-5)

4. **Create service layer**
   - Create services directory
   - Move business logic from routes to service classes
   - Update route handlers to use the service classes
   - Add comprehensive type hints
   - Verify all tests pass

5. **Implement centralized error handling**
   - Create error handler utility
   - Define custom exception classes
   - Register error handlers with Flask app
   - Update routes to use the api_route decorator
   - Replace manual error handling with exceptions

6. **Add request validation**
   - Install Marshmallow
   - Create schema definitions
   - Update route handlers to use schemas
   - Implement appropriate error responses

### Phase 3: Frontend Improvements - Lower Risk (Weeks 6-8)

7. **Create API service layer**
   - Create API directory with configuration
   - Implement separate API modules for different features
   - Replace direct fetch calls with API service methods
   - Update error handling

8. **Refactor custom hooks**
   - Improve error handling in hooks
   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Implement better caching strategies
   - Update components that use these hooks

9. **Break down large components**
   - Identify components with multiple responsibilities
   - Split them into smaller, focused components
   - Create proper interfaces for component props
   - Update imports and usages

### Phase 4: Backend Improvements - Higher Risk (Weeks 9-11)

10. **Implement SQLAlchemy ORM**
    - Set up SQLAlchemy configuration
    - Create model classes for database tables
    - Update services to use SQLAlchemy models
    - Create database migration scripts
    - Verify all functionality works as before

11. **Improve route organization**
    - Convert route functions to class-based views
    - Group related routes under the same blueprint
    - Add method-level documentation
    - Apply decorators for common functionality

### Phase 5: Frontend Improvements - Higher Risk (Weeks 12-14)

12. **Reorganize folder structure**
    - Create new directory structure
    - Move files to appropriate folders
    - Update import paths
    - Ensure tests still work

13. **Improve state management**
    - Create Context and provider
    - Implement reducer functions
    - Replace existing state management
    - Update components to use the new state management

### Phase 6: Security and Performance (Weeks 15-16)

14. **Enhance security**
    - Implement rate limiting
    - Add input sanitization
    - Conduct security audit

15. **Optimize performance**
    - Identify performance bottlenecks
    - Implement memoization
    - Set up caching strategies
    - Configure code splitting

### Phase 7: Final Verification and Cleanup (Weeks 17-18)

16. **Final testing and verification**
    - Run comprehensive tests
    - Verify application behavior
    - Check for regressions

17. **Code cleanup**
    - Remove unused code/dependencies
    - Finalize documentation
    - Ensure all old code is removed

## Implementation Guidelines

For each change:

1. Implement the specific refactoring task on the current branch
2. Run tests to ensure functionality remains intact
3. Fix any failing tests or issues
4. Commit code and push changes
5. Proceed to the next refactoring task without switching branches

Note: No need to create feature branches. All changes will be made directly on the current branch and pushed once verified.

## Questions and Clarifications

1. **Database Migration Strategy**: The document mentions replacing direct database connections with SQLAlchemy ORM. Will we need to migrate existing data? Is there a preferred migration tool (Alembic, etc.)?
   - **Response**: No, data does not need to be migrated. We can ignore data migration and start with a clean slate.

2. **Frontend State Management**: The plan suggests replacing the custom finite state machine with React Context and useReducer. Are there any specific state transitions or edge cases in the current implementation that require special attention?
   - **Response**: There are no specific state transitions or edge cases in current implementation that require special attention.

3. **API Changes**: Will the refactoring involve any changes to API endpoints or response formats? If so, will there be any version compatibility requirements to maintain?
   - **Response**: No version compatibility requirements to maintain. The application is still in development and has not been released yet so we can change API endpoints or response formats.

4. **Testing Requirements**: What is the minimum acceptable test coverage for the refactored code? Are there specific testing tools or frameworks that should be used beyond pytest and Jest?
   - **Response**: pytest and Jest are fine for now. No other test coverage for refactored code is required. The application will be manually regression tested.

5. **Deployment Process**: How will the refactored code be deployed? Will we need a staged deployment approach or feature flags to gradually roll out changes?
   - **Response**: Application is still in development so it needs to run functionally accurately locally. There is no deployment process yet as the application has not been deployed for the first time.

6. **Performance Metrics**: Are there existing performance benchmarks that we should maintain or improve upon during the refactoring?
   - **Response**: No performance metrics at the moment. None that need to be maintained or improved upon.

7. **Integration Points**: The instructions mention that frontend and backend will be deployed to different servers. Are there any integration points that require special attention during refactoring?
   - **Response**: None at the moment since the application is yet to be deployed for the first time.

8. **Documentation Requirements**: Beyond code comments and README.md, are there any other documentation deliverables expected (API documentation, architecture diagrams, etc.)?
   - **Response**: None at the moment, for now we stick to README.md.

By following this phased approach, we can ensure that the application remains functional throughout the refactoring process while systematically improving the codebase architecture, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
