### Jira Story: Frontend Workflow for Personalised AI Agent Creation

**Story ID:** FRONTEND-001  
**Title:** Implement React Frontend Workflow for Personalised AI Agent Creation  

**Description:**  
Develop a React-based frontend workflow to engage users and collect necessary information for creating a personalised AI agent. The workflow will guide users through a series of steps, including providing their name, email address, uploading a document, and generating a personalised AI agent. The workflow will also email the user a link to access their AI agent.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. **User Engagement Workflow:**  
   - Display a welcome message to the user upon landing on the homepage.  
   - Provide options for the user to proceed or exit the workflow.  

2. **Name Collection:**  
   - Prompt the user to provide their name.  
   - Validate the input to ensure it contains only letters and spaces.  
   - Display an error message for invalid inputs.  

3. **Email Collection:**  
   - Prompt the user to provide their email address.  
   - Validate the email format.  
   - Implement a two-step email confirmation process.  

4. **Document Upload:**  
   - Allow users to upload a document (PDF format, max size 10 MB).  
   - Validate the uploaded document for format and size.  
   - Display an error message for invalid uploads.  

5. **AI Agent Creation:**  
   - Once all required information is collected, initiate the creation of a personalised AI agent.  
   - Display a progress message during the creation process.  

6. **Email Notification:**  
   - Send an email to the user with a link to access their personalised AI agent.  
   - Ensure the email includes a confirmation message and instructions for accessing the agent.  

7. **Error Handling:**  
   - Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or failed processes.  
   - Provide retry options for users in case of errors.  

8. **Frontend Components:**  
   - Develop reusable React functional components for chat history, input area, file upload, and button groups.  
   - Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.  

9. **State Management:**  
   - Implement a finite state machine to manage the workflow states and transitions.  
   - Ensure smooth transitions between states based on user actions.  

10. **Styling:**  
    - Apply responsive and user-friendly styling to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.  

**Technical Notes:**  
- Use React with TypeScript for frontend development.  
- Leverage a finite state machine for state management.  
- Follow PEP 8 and ESLint guidelines for code quality.  
- Mock external dependencies during testing.  

**Attachments:**  
- Refer to the attached workflow diagram (`Requirements.png`) for detailed implementation steps.  

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Labels:** React, TypeScript, Workflow, AI Agent  

**Tasks:**  
1. Develop the chat container and history components.  
2. Implement the finite state machine for workflow management.  
3. Create input validation for name and email fields.  
4. Develop the file upload component with validation.  
5. Integrate the AI agent creation process.  
6. Implement email notification functionality.  
7. Write Jest tests to cover all edge cases.  
8. Apply responsive styling to all components.  

**Dependencies:**  
- Backend API for AI agent creation and email notifications.  
- crewAI configurations for agent orchestration.  

**Testing:**  
- Use Jest for unit and integration testing.  
- Mock API calls and external dependencies.  
- Test edge cases for input validation and error handling.  

**Definition of Done:**  
- All acceptance criteria are met.  
- Code is reviewed and adheres to coding standards.  
- Tests are written and achieve 100% coverage.  
- The workflow is deployed and functional in the development environment.
